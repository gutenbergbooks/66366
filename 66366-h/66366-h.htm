<h2><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>In an older generation, especially among the
writers of the more lurid types of fiction,
it was an accepted axiom that &ldquo;Dead men
tell no tales!&rdquo; But this was before the great
era of modern archeology had impressed its
findings on the general public, and indeed
before most of those discoveries had been
made.</p>
<p>Our generation knows better. Dead men
<i>do</i> tell tales, and marvelous and wonderful
are the stories they bring to us. By means
of an archeological resurrection, the great
men of antiquity are with us again. Once
more we hear the accounts of their fascinating
lives and adventures, and read again the
records of their culture. The tongueless
tombs of the distant past have suddenly become
vocal, and this mighty chorus of the
dead great has forced us to revise many of
our once cherished opinions.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more strikingly true than
in the case of the coincidence of these old ages
with the page of the Holy Bible. The richest
finds of archeology come to us from the very
periods of history that are dealt with in the
pages of Holy Writ, and names that were
known only from the record of the Scripture
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
are now the common possession of the scholarly
world. So much is this the case, that we
have a new technique of Bible study in our
day. Just as the microscope is the instrument
for the study of biology, and the spectroscope
has become the means of study in
physics, so the Bible is best read today in
the light that is reflected upon its pages from
the blade of a spade! This, of course, is intended
to apply to the historical sections of
the Book, and refers to the problem of its
authenticity and historicity. It still remains
true that <i>spiritual</i> understanding of its message
can be derived only from study that is
supervised and directed by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>This volume, the fourth in the promised
series to be known as the</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;JOHN LAURENCE FROST
<br />MEMORIAL LIBRARY&rdquo;</p>
<p>will deal with some of those fascinating discoveries
that bear particularly on the problem
of the Old Testament. The succeeding
and companion volume, which will be entitled
&ldquo;Crying Stones,&rdquo; will deal in like manner
with the records of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The material contained in this apologetic
is derived from various sources. Much of
it came from records in the famed British
Museum, in London, England. This marvelous
storehouse of treasure from the most
remote antiquity is the greatest collection
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
of evidence bearing upon these questions,
that is at present in the possession of man.
There is scarcely a section of the Bible that
does not receive some authentication from
the limitless wealth of this noble treasury.</p>
<p>A great deal of the remainder of this information
and proof has been derived from
other museums, such as the Egyptian Museum
at Cairo, Egypt, and the Museum of
the University of Pennsylvania. Much of
the contents of this book has come from the
excavations now in progress in Egypt, and
from the ruins at Sakkara, Luxor, Karnak,
Iraq, and other centers of present activity.
The earth seems eager indeed to offer its
treasures of proof concerning the Word of
God.</p>
<p>The author is especially grateful for the
help accorded to him in Egypt by Mr. and
Mrs. Erian Boutros of Cairo, and by certain
officials of the Egyptian government,
chief of whom in helpfulness was M. Abdul
Nabi, and the Egyptian Tourist Bureau, whose
gracious efforts on our behalf won us many
privileges from the Department of Antiquities.</p>
<p>The illustrations used in this volume are
largely from the author&rsquo;s own photographs of
exhibits and evidences, made by him and
presented with the assurance that they are
not retouched or altered in any manner. In
the course of his studies and travels in search
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
of this material, he made hundreds of negatives,
only a few of which appear in this
work. The exceptions to this are noted where
they appear. The zinc etchings are made
from original drawings by Miss Elizabeth
Elverhoy from our photographs, and are authentic
in all details.</p>
<p>We hand you now Tales of Dead Men,
rendered by Men Long Dead, as they unconsciously
accredit the sacred page of the
Word of God. If you have a tithe of the
pleasure and profit in the reading of these
pages that we have experienced in the gathering
of their contents, we shall be repaid
for the labor involved.</p>

<br />The Premise Stated</h2>
<p>In the romantic vocabulary of the twentieth
century few words are more potent to
arouse the interest of the average man than
the fascinating word &ldquo;archeology.&rdquo; A flood
of volumes has come forth from the press
of our generation covering almost every
phase of this now popular science. After
one hundred years of steady plodding and determined
digging, this school of research has
at last come into its own and today occupies
deserved prominence in the world of current
literature. This science, which deals exclusively
with dead races and the records of
their conduct is, to many, the most fascinating
field of investigation at present open to
the inquiring mind of man. Nothing is of
such interest to the human as is humanity.
The study of the life and record of our own
kind rightly means more to us than can most
other subjects.</p>
<p>But the true appreciation of the value of
the contribution of archeology to our modern
learning can be appreciated only by those
who grasp an outstanding fact that should
be self-apparent, but is so often overlooked:
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Namely, these records derived from musty
tombs and burial mounds constitute the
daily events in the lives of <i>human beings</i>! The
folks who left these records were ordinary
people such as make up the nations of the
earth today. They are not merely names on
tablets or faces carved in stone. They were
actual flesh-and-blood individuals with all
that this implies. In hours of merriment they
laughed, and they shed tears in moments of
sorrow. They hungered, and ate for satisfaction;
they drank when they were thirsty.
They loved and they hated; they lived and
they died. Pleasure and pain were their alternating
companions, while ambition, aspiration,
and hope drove them on the endless
round of their daily tasks.</p>
<p>In a word, they were <i>real</i>. Their life was
as important to them as is your life, and they
lived it in much the same way. Therefore,
the records written by humans and studied
by their kind, who now live these thousands
of years later, constitute the source of the
most human science with which our generation
has to deal.</p>
<p>The contributions of archeology have
reached almost every branch of study, but
to no particular group of people have they
been more timely and valuable than to students
of the Bible. The hoary antiquity of
the Book which has been received in every
generation by the intelligent and the discerning
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
as the Word of God, has its roots
in the same generations that archeology is
investigating today. It is inevitable that
much of the material being recovered by modern
excavations shall have important bearing
upon the various questions skepticism may
raise concerning the text of the Scripture.</p>
<p>To the open-minded scholar who approaches
this subject without prejudice, the science
of archeology has a twofold contribution to
make. Some of the evidences derived from
digging are (a) of incalculable value in illuminating
the text of the Scripture, and
are (b) equally priceless when viewed as a
body of indisputable evidence. Under this
latter heading the proofs would come into
four classifications:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">1. The historicity of the text</p>
<p class="t0">2. The accuracy of the account</p>
<p class="t0">3. The authenticity of the record</p>
<p class="t0">4. The inspiration of the whole</p>
</div>
<p>By way of illustrating the manner in which
the Scripture may be illumined by the findings
of archeology, we would introduce a
semi-humorous and partially tragic event that
occurred in the dim and distant days of our
own earlier studies. During a short term
spent at a well known California college,
we were specializing in the field of history.
The teacher of this course, Professor Rosenberger,
was one of the ablest pedagogues
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
who ever wasted her life in the more or
less important task of teaching a rising generation
how to think! At the end of the
first few weeks in a class in English history,
she informed the student group that the
following day we would be privileged to have
a test in this particular subject. When the
class gathered for the happy event, there
were twenty questions written on the board
which were to constitute our examination.</p>
<p>The first question was something like this,
&ldquo;What new treaty had just been signed between
France and Spain at this particular
period?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next question had to do with the political
commitments of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The third question took us into the Germanic
states, and in all of the twenty questions
not one word concerning England was
mentioned!</p>
<p>As the class sat with the usual and habitual
expression of vacuity which generally adorns
the countenance of a college student facing
a quiz, the Professor said, &ldquo;You may begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some hapless wight procured the courage
to protest, by saying, &ldquo;But you said this was
to be an examination in English history!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor replied, &ldquo;Quite so! This
<i>is</i> English history!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then leaning forward over the desk she
said, in impressive tones, &ldquo;How can you expect
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
to know what England is doing, and
why, if you do not know the pressure upon
her of her enemies and friends at that particular
period?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long distance back in our mental vacuum
a dim light began to glow, and we never
were caught that way again! When the
teacher said French history, we read everything
else! When she said German history,
we specialized on the surrounding countries.
One day as we were thinking over this helpful
technique of understanding, the idea began
to grow that if this was the proper way to
study secular history, <i>it ought to apply to
Bible study as well</i>!</p>
<p>There is an illumination that brightens the
meaning of the Sacred Text when read in
the light of collateral events that can come
no other way. As an instance of this, we will
remind the reader of the background of
Isaiah. When this prophet first began to
write, there was trouble between Israel, the
northern confederation, and Judah, the
southern kingdom. The king of Israel at this
time was Pekah, the son of Remaliah, and
although his people were numerically superior
to Judah, he was fearful that he might
not be strong enough to overcome the southern
kingdom in the threatened war. Therefore,
he made a close alliance with Rezin,
the king of Syria, promising him all the
spoils of the battle, if he would aid with
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
his army and strength. The Syrian king
hastened to accept this offer, and signed the
required covenant. When this alliance became
known in Judah, a natural alarm spread
throughout the tiny kingdom. Realizing that
they were incapable of resisting the strong
forces of Israel and Syria which had combined
against them, the princes of Judah desired
outside help. The only apparent source
of such assistance was Egypt. So in the
court of Ahaz, the king of Judah, a strong
party began agitating for a military alliance
with Egypt. That being the only apparent
aid within any reasonable distance, it seemed
natural to turn to them for a military alliance.</p>
<p>The prophet Isaiah, who was a strong force
and exercised a vital influence in the policies
of Judah, began to object most strenuously.
In the light of this background, we can understand
such outbursts of Isaiah as are
found in the thirtieth chapter of his prophecy,
verses one to three:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Woe to the rebellious children, saith the
Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and
that cover with a covering, but not of my
Spirit, that they may add sin to sin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That walk to go down into Egypt, and have
not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves
in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust
in the shadow of Egypt!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
your shame, and the trust in the shadow of
Egypt your confusion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His protest seems to reach a climax in the
thirty-first chapter in that magnificently
written plea for faith in God which we find
in these graphic words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help;
and stay on horses, and trust in chariots,
because they are many; and in horsemen, because
they are very strong; but they look not
unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the
Lord!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and
will not call back his words: but will arise
against the house of the evil doers, and against
the help of them that work iniquity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the Egyptians are men, and not God;
and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When
the Lord shall stretch out his hand, both he
that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen
shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All through this period of prophecy,
Isaiah&rsquo;s voice is aggressively raised against
the folly of trusting Egypt. His protest is,
&ldquo;Since God redeemed us once from bondage
in that land, why put ourselves back again
under their yoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princes replied in some such terms
as this: &ldquo;The objection is o. k. <i>in principle</i>;
as a basic thesis we will admit that it is safe
to trust in God. But right now we need real
help and we need it in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The prophet cried out in response, &ldquo;God
will send the help that you need!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The natural question was &ldquo;Whence?
Syria and Egypt are the only two powers
near us. One is arrayed against us and the
help of the other you forbid us to seek.
Whence then is the aid that God will send?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prophet&rsquo;s reply was short and terse,
&ldquo;God will send aid from very far off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reluctant court agreed to take a chance
on Isaiah&rsquo;s insistence, and so to trust their
cause to the God of Israel. Quickly, then,
upon the heels of this decision, as we learn
from the records of archeology, there came
one of the earlier battles that were fought
at Charchemish.</p>
<p>The rising power of Assyria first made itself
felt in that engagement. As a result,
Syria was shattered and Israel made captive.
The help that God had promised did come,
and now the definite prophecy of Isaiah, in
chapters seven and eight, may be correlated
into this simple summary; and against this
background we can understand the vehemence
of Isaiah in crying out against an alliance
with Egypt.</p>
<p>It is not too much to say, as we shall later
show in detail, that in our present possession
there is sufficient knowledge derived from
the monuments and records of antiquity to
authenticate every prophecy that Isaiah
made concerning Egypt, Israel, Syria, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Assyria. Thus the text of the Old Testament
is illumined, and a floodlight of understanding
thrown upon its prophetic utterance by
the findings in this field.</p>
<p>Even more striking is the contribution of
archeology in the second field, that of evidence
in defense of the accepted text. The
museums, monuments, and libraries of the
world are teeming with such evidences, and
it shall be the purpose of this volume to condense,
epitomize, and present much of that
evidence in a simple and readable form, divorced
from technical obscurities. Right
here, however, we offer just one simple illustration
under each of the subdivisions
suggested in the paragraph above.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the evidence of the Bible&rsquo;s
historicity, we shall offer the illustration
made famous by the late Dr. Robert Dick
Wilson, as to the record of the forty-seven
kings of antiquity. It is probably known to
the reader that the historical sections of the
Old Testament contain the names of forty-seven
kings, aside from the rulers of Israel
and Judah. These foreign, or Gentile kings,
have been known by name for many centuries
to every reader of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The odd thing is that until comparatively
recent times, these names had been dropped
out of secular history. Mighty as these men
had each been in his day, they were completely
forgotten by posterity and for some
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
twenty-three hundred years their names were
unknown to the scholars of secular events.
For this reason the learned leaders of &ldquo;higher
criticism&rdquo; relegated these forty-seven monarchs
to the columns of mythology. They
were grouped among &ldquo;the fables and folklore
of the Old Testament&rdquo; which this deluded
school mistakenly taught was one of the basic
weaknesses of the text. Then one after another
these disputed monarchs began to rise
from the dead in an archeological resurrection.
In some cases a burial mound was uncovered;
in others, an annalistic tablet, a
boundary marker, or a great building inscribed
with the monarch&rsquo;s name. Now, all
forty-seven of these presumably fabulous
characters have been transferred from the
columns of &ldquo;mythology&rdquo; to the accepted records
of established history.</p>
<p>In forty-seven specific instances, as these
kings rose from the dead past, they were
recognized, as their names were not strange
to true historians. Each was remembered
from his appearance in the page of the Old
Testament which had preserved his memory
with accuracy. Thus, in this simple instance
there are forty-seven definite and specific
evidences of the complete historicity of the
text.</p>
<p>To stress this point, the accuracy of the
record, we shall cite a semi-humorous illustration.
The great Greek historian, Herodotus,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
who is supposed to be the &ldquo;Father of
History,&rdquo; wrote some more or less accurate
observations concerning the land of Egypt.
Among other things, he said that the Egyptians
grew no grapes and drank no wine.</p>
<p>There was another ancient who preceded
this historian by many centuries, who also
wrote voluminously about Egypt and her
customs. This was the man Moses, who being
reared in the bosom of the royal family
as the crown prince and heir apparent, might
be presumed to know considerably more
about Egyptian customs than any casual visitor.
Moses stated that the Egyptians <i>did</i>
grow grapes and that they <i>did</i> drink wine.
In fact, he recounts that Joseph was in jail
with the chief cupbearer of Pharaoh, the
butler whose business was the purveying of
wine to the royal table. It may be remembered
that in the butler&rsquo;s dream he saw himself
<i>standing by the vine, squeezing the grapes
into the cup</i>.</p>
<p>This brought these two authorities into
sharp opposition. Since Herodotus was supposed
to be the final authority on matters of
antiquity, the critics fell upon this discrepancy
with considerable glee. The argument
might still be going on, if it were not for the
discovery of an unquestionable bit of evidence
among the frescoes that decorate the
tombs of Egyptian antiquity. These frescoes
showed the Egyptians engaged in the art of
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
viticulture. In some of these pictures they
were dressing and pruning the vines, cultivating
and tending their crop. In others
of the pictures they were seen to be gathering
the grapes and conveying them to the press.
The ingenious method of extracting the
juice was clearly portrayed in these illuminating
frescoes, which showed the juice being
stored in stone jugs, clay pots, and skin bottles
for future use. Since the ancients called any
fruit juice that was used for drinking purposes
by the name of wine, whether it was
fresh or sweet, it is highly probable that some
of this juice was drunk in an unfermented
condition.</p>
<p>However, one of the murals depicted an
Egyptian party gathered around the banquet
board, making merry with the juice of the
grape (See <a href="#pl1">Plate 1</a>). The incidental
evidences show very clearly that the juice
was fermented. Off in the corner, the picture
depicts a noble lady who is portrayed
with her slave holding a silver bowl, while
she gave up the excess fluids that had evidently
disagreed with the more commendable
parts of the banquet! Another of these murals
showed the morning light coming into
such a banqueting hall, as the slaves were
all carrying their masters home; with the
exception of one inebriate who had slid under
the table and had evidently been overlooked
in the excitement!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Did the Egyptians grow grapes and drink
wine?</p>
<p>Herodotus said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moses said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The critics, to their later embarrassment,
lined up solidly with Herodotus.</p>
<p>But since archeology has accredited the
accuracy of Moses, this argument is no longer
heard in the halls of learning.</p>
<p>When we come to the question of authenticity,
we shall later give many evidences
that none of the records of the Bible, either
the Old Testament or the New, are, in any
sense of the word, forgeries. They are uniformly
authentic in that they were written
by the men whose names they bear.</p>
<p>A classical illustration of this is found in
the fact that Sir William Ramsay, one of the
greatest archeologists of our generation, began
his work in his early days under the
bias of the critical position that Luke was
not the author of either the Gospel that bears
his name or the book of the Acts of the
Apostles. After forty years of research in
Asia Minor, Sir William Ramsay himself discovered
the evidence that converted him personally
to the orthodox and historical view,
and demonstrated conclusively that Luke unquestionably
wrote the two books that are
accredited to him. As we shall deal with
this matter more extensively in the fifth
volume of this series, we pass on to the present
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
cause of modern controversy, namely,
the inspiration of the text.</p>
<p>The fact of inspiration is stated so often
by the writers of the Scripture that we must
accept their explanation of the origin of these
pages, or else classify them as the most consistent
liars that humanity has ever produced.
They claim a supernatural guidance
by the Holy Ghost which has kept their records
free from error or discrepancy. For
one who has examined and analyzed the
Scripture in the unprejudiced light of archeology,
this claim is vindicated at every turn
of the spade.</p>
<p>A simple illustration of the manner in
which our science does show the inspiration
of the Scripture, may be found from the
prophetic sections of the Old Testament. In
the days of Isaiah and his fellow prophets,
the capital of Egypt was the city of No. It
is also called Amon, and sometimes, No-Amon.
It was a populous city of wealth
and culture, being the center of learning, as
well as the seat of government. In a day
when Egypt dominated the world and No-Amon
was the mistress of antiquity, obscure
Hebrew prophets raised their voices
in denunciation of No in such arbitrary and
extreme statements as are found in the
thirtieth chapter of Ezekiel. Denouncing the
sin of Egypt and their repeated betrayals of
Israel, Ezekiel warns Egypt that her land
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
shall be overrun with fire and sword, and
that No-Amon shall be desolate and forsaken.</p>
<p>There must have been a strong element
of humor in all of this outcry to the proud
mind of the Egyptian of that day! No-Amon,
also called Thebes, spreading out on both
banks of the Nile, in complacent, serene
command of the ancient world, apparently
had nothing to fear from the bitter cries of
a prophet of Israel. Yet today the visitor
to the site of Thebes, or No-Amon, to use the
more ancient name, is faced with a scene
of desolation that is utterly devoid of any
human habitation.</p>
<p>Since it is impossible for the human mind
to pick up the curtain of time and peer ahead
into future events, prophecy can derive only
from the Holy Spirit. The work of archeologists
in identifying the bleak and barren
site of No-Amon portrays the inspiration of
the Scripture. The proud city is forgotten
except for its inscriptions on records of antiquity
and the denunciations to be found in
the Word of God. Thus we have simply illustrated
how this dignified and sober science
is bringing to us illumination of the text, together
with the evidences of the HISTORICITY,
ACCURACY, AUTHENTICITY,
and INSPIRATION of the Bible.</p>
<p>This is eminently fitting, since this peculiar
science is most intimately concerned with the
problem of the credibility of the Bible. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
unique and heavenly nature of the Book is
in itself a divisive factor. Multitudes of men
and women love it and would die for its
preservation. Indeed, it is no exaggeration
of fact to say that multitudes <i>have</i> died in its
defense. There are others who hate the Book
and would go to any length to discredit it,
except the extreme length of martyrdom. It
is very natural for men to die for what they
believe, but few men will surrender their
lives for what they disbelieve!</p>
<p>This division is decidedly fitting and proper.
Men and women who are saved by the grace
of God recognize the supernatural nature of
the Book that is the means of their redemption.
Men and women who are lost, resent
the honesty of that Book in that it condemns
their sin and iniquity.</p>
<p>In our day and age, infidelity has, under
the guise of an attempted scientific refutation,
directed its chief argument against the
integrity of the Scripture. Living in an age of
science, when all things are again evaluated
in the light of man&rsquo;s technical knowledge, it
is inevitable that the Bible should come in
for this type of investigation. No exponent
of Scripture would wish it otherwise. If the
Bible is honestly examined without prejudice,
under any system of truth, it will maintain
its integrity and establish its own supernatural
character.</p>
<p>The so-called scientific investigation of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
Scripture, however, has not been made on
the basis of credible science. Rather, the
prejudiced enemies have sought to gather
from pseudo-scientific claims such help and
hope for their opinions as would bolster their
failing school. We frankly admit that the text
of the Bible <i>does</i> refute the fallacies of men
of science. There is a great deal of theoretical
speculation indulged in by men who call
themselves scientists, and who march under
the banner of technical learning. In every
age, when such fallacious theories are current,
the Bible is necessarily repudiated by the exponents
of those false ideas. Few such men,
however, know the Bible, and their opposition
has no lasting effect. This Book does
not stand in <i>any</i> age by human consent, but
has been able to maintain itself in <i>every</i> age
by the inherent power of its supernatural
character.</p>
<p>The science of archeology has played a
great and leading role in demolishing these
fallacies of a pseudo-scientific generation.</p>
<p>As an instance of this, we may note that
the theory of organic evolution is unquestionably
incompatible with the record of the
Scripture. In the &ldquo;dark ages&rdquo; of biology
which began to draw to a close at the beginning
of this present decade, the thoughts of
men were so darkened by the general acceptance
of the baseless and unscientific
theory of man&rsquo;s animal origin, as sadly to
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
handicap capable research and frustrate the
pursuit of real knowledge. We see again,
however, that truth, though crushed to the
earth, will rise again. For certainly no one
who is within ten years of being up to date
in the facts of biology and the discoveries of
archeology, will contend any longer for the
animal origin of the human species.</p>
<p>The theory cannot be harmonized with the
record of the Scripture. Therefore, in the
days of blindness, when this particular theory
possessed the imagination of men, it was
used as an argument against the integrity of
the text of the Word of God. This whole
problem simmers down to a simple illustration.
In dealing with the origin of man,
there are two horses. The problem of every
man is to decide which one he shall ride.
One horse is known by the name of &ldquo;specific
creation,&rdquo; and the other is called &ldquo;organic
evolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible to ride them both at once.
In riding two horses at one time, it is necessary
to keep them close together and both
going <i>in the same direction</i>. There is no record
of anyone who successfully rode two
horses simultaneously when they were headed
in <i>opposite</i> directions!</p>
<p>These two premises are irreconcilable. The
first is that man was created in perfection.
In the moment of his fiat origin, he was
formed by the hand of God, gifted with all
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
the arts and cultures by a process of involution.
The word &ldquo;involution&rdquo; simply means
&ldquo;to come down into.&rdquo; That is to say, all of
the graces and abilities possessed by man
<i>were imparted by creation</i>.</p>
<p>The second theory is that &ldquo;man has himself
consummated a gradual ascent from a
brutish state to our present high and civilized
condition.&rdquo; (If there were room in such a
work as this for sarcasm, we might say that
this is another way of noting that we have
left the arrow and the club for heavy artillery,
poison gas and aerial bomb. If one were
to wax facetious, one might be tempted to
suggest that if the present condition of international
hatred, mass murder, violated treaties,
forgotten honor, and civilian extermination
in the holy name of war, are the best
that evolution can accomplish, we should
hand the whole mess back to the monkeys
and ask them to stir up another batch!)</p>
<p>But to remain upon the sober grounds of
scientific inquiry, it is not too much to say
that the archeologist speaks upon this problem
with absolute finality. There is nothing
theoretical about archeology. <i>What you
dig up with your own hands, you are inclined
to believe.</i></p>
<p>Some years ago we had a college lad on
one of our expeditions who was strongly addicted
to the theory of organic evolution. At
the beginning of the work the lad showed
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
some disposition to argue, and was somewhat
disappointed that we refused to enter into
debate with him upon our differing theories.
As day followed day, however, and we got
into the rich contents of burial mounds containing
a fabulous amount of ossi, this lad
became deeply concerned with the discrepancies
between his textbook learning and
what he saw in his own personal recoveries
of ancient skeletons.</p>
<p>Every time he came to us with some bone
that did not fit in with his classroom theories,
we would laugh and say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother us.
<i>You</i> dug that up. This poor bone never read
your textbook and it doesn&rsquo;t know how you
want it to be. Now, which are you going
to believe? The schematized drawing in a
textbook written by some professor who
never saw a burial mound, or this evidence
that you yourself have acquired by your own
labor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of that one summer, this student
returned to the campus an ardent and bitter
anti-evolutionist, denouncing the false teachings
which had misled him by means of the
printed page.</p>
<p>In a word, other sciences may speculate,
theorize and deduce, but archeology delves
and demonstrates. Some of these demonstrations
will be seen in the contents of the
following pages. We say <i>some</i>: for if all the
evidence from the realm of archeology were
massed into one great volume, no derrick
ever built by man could lift its tremendous
bulk and weight. In such a work as this
one we are handicapped and embarrassed,
not by the paucity of evidence, but rather by
its over-abundance.</p>

<p>It shall be the purpose of the following

men call the Bible is historically credible,
scientifically accurate, and has been derived
by inspiration from the Spirit of God.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />The Tides of Culture</h2>
<p>In almost every branch of this fascinating
science, archeology has been the handmaid
of revelation. Even more, it has acted as
a beacon to illuminate the pathway to God,
which men call the Bible. The problem of
the antiquity and culture of man was the
battleground of infidelity which the skeptical
chose to demonstrate the fallacy of the Bible&rsquo;s
claims to supernatural origin.</p>
<p>If it can be proved by the aid of science
that the human race is older than is implied
by the Genesis account of creation, and if it
can be shown that man has ascended from
a dim and brutish ancestry, instead of being
created perfect by the hand of God, the foundation
would admittedly be swept from beneath
the Scripture, and the entire structure
of revelation collapses. However, this unwarranted
attempt to confuse the issue and
refute the Scripture, is manifestly unfair to
science. It is not too much to say that this
is a debasing of the highest labors of human
mentality. Research, in the exact sense of
the word, cannot be used legitimately to establish
a pet theory to which the advocate
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
clings without regard to evidence in the case.
The attempt to demonstrate the organic evolution
of man belongs in the realm of philosophy
and not of science. The work of
science is the correlation of facts. The sphere
of philosophy is the interpretation of facts.
In all of this controversy, we are not debating
the facts of humanity, but are at odds concerning
the application of those facts. The
real issue then is not the <i>antiquity</i> of man, but
the <i>origin</i> of man!</p>
<p>In the hope of obscuring the manner of
origin, the enemy of our faith has sought to
raise the dust storm of antiquity. It is here
more than anywhere else, that archeology
has been such a tremendous aid to the establishment
of the truth. This science has
demonstrated the premise of the Scripture,
namely, the fixity and origin of our species.
As far back as the spade has been able to
thrust the history of humanity, we find the
same types and varieties of the human family
that exist upon the earth today. Since we
are covering this problem of antiquity and
origin in the sixth volume of this series, we
will hasten on with this brief statement of
the issue involved. We will later show that
all of the statements made in the text of the
Scripture concerning the degeneration and
moral collapse of humanity have been abundantly
demonstrated in the realm of archeology.
Further, the claims that we make as
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
to the historicity of the Bible can be demonstrated
satisfactorily in one single field;
namely, the recording of the story of man and
the care used by the Scripture writers in the
exactness of their statements. In this display
of historical accuracy, the writers of the Bible
have incidentally repudiated the entire
philosophy of organic evolution. It is not
too much to say that no single evidence derived
in the entire realm and history of archeology
has sustained the theory of organic
evolution. Remember that we are dealing
specifically with evidence. If the evidence
is rightly interpreted and honestly implied,
item by item and in the aggregate mass, it
refutes the entire fallacy of this weird philosophy.</p>
<p>Since it deals with the realm of human history,
archeology is the final voice as to the
antiquity and culture of man. No race of
man has ever lived upon the face of this
earth and failed to leave some relics or evidences
of its existence and culture.</p>
<p>The science of anthropology postulates the
beginning of the human family somewhere in
Mesopotamia. The Bible is a little more
specific, in that it states that it was in that
portion of Mesopotamia which lies between
the two rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates.
The oldest relics of man, however, are not
found in Mesopotamia. This is due to the
climatic conditions in certain parts of that
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
ancient land. The rainfall is heavy. We
have ourselves suffered great inconvenience,
delay, and loss by being isolated from our
objective in Mesopotamia by floods that filled
the wadies and gullies and made travel impossible.
Also, the outlying country is underlaid
to a great extent by water. When
excavators dig but a short way into the
strata of that land, they are handicapped
and hindered by seepage. Because of this
excess moisture, some of the oldest relics of
our race have been destroyed by the ravages
of time and the power of the elements.</p>
<p>The situation in Egypt, however, is quite
the opposite. In most of that land there is
no rain and in no part of that bleak country
do we experience frost. The climate is dry
to the utmost extreme, and the soil is largely
sand. Due to this natural condition, the
oldest records of the human race are found
in Egypt. The oldest records of man and the
most complete records so far recovered of
his early existence have been preserved for
us by this combination of climate and soil.
Since the Egyptians buried in sand or in
stone tombs, the deposits being protected
from the elements, man was the only destroyer.
Even though there has been a sad
record of vandalism, as ruthless hands of the
ignorant have despoiled magnificent tombs
of priceless records and information, there
is much that remained undisturbed. The
people of Egypt built for endurance. The
mighty pyramids, from Sakkara to the Great
Pyramid; the Colossi at Luxor and the awe-inspiring
ruins of Karnak, are present evidences
of the durability of their labors. (See
plates <a href="#pl2">2</a>, <a href="#pl3">3</a> and <a href="#pl4">4</a>.)
Because of the strange beliefs
concerning the life after death, these
people also buried for eternity. We shall
later consider, in the light of their customs
and religious practices, the tremendous value
that modern civilization has derived from
this ancient fact. We have mentioned this
fact now merely to note that the greatest
treasure trove of preserved antiquity is found
in the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>Strangely, in view of the consistent demands
of the evolutionary school, we find
no evidence of human evolution in the land
of Egypt. More than this, the doctrine that
man began with a brutish intellect and gradually
developed his high and peculiar culture,
is refuted by the evidences from this
country. In fact, the contrary is strikingly
the case. Instead of proving a process of
evolution, the history of man as found in
the archeology of Egypt is a consistent record
of degeneration.</p>
<p>The eminent Sayce, one of the ablest archeologists
in the whole history of that great
science, expressed his wonder and amazement
at the high stage of culture met with
in the very earliest records of the Egyptian
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
people. Other authorities, such as Baikie,
have written voluminously upon this subject.
It had been hoped that when excavators
finally reached undisturbed tombs of the
first dynasty, they would find themselves
in the dawn of Egyptian culture. It was our
fortunate privilege to be at Sakkara a year
ago when the first complete and unmolested
tombs of the first dynasty were uncovered.
It was our privilege to keep a close check and
watch upon all that was done at that time,
and the conclusions and postulations of hopeful
theorists were utterly shattered in such
discoveries as were made.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can no longer start Egyptian
culture with the beginning of the dynastic
ages. Through the first tombs, we peer back
into an older preceding culture that dazzles
and amazes the human understanding. Instead
of finding the dawn of a developing
humanity, we see mankind already in the
high noon of cultural accomplishments. Instead
of nomadic dwellers in shaggy tents,
we look upon works of enduring stone. Instead
of brutish, Egyptian ancestral artifacts,
we find a pottery culture that is really superb.
It almost seems that the farther back
we go into Egyptian antiquity, the more perfect
was their culture and learning. The
art of writing was the common possession of
the Egyptian in the pre-dynastic period.</p>
<p>It is true that there was a so-called stone
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
age in Egypt, which preceded the first dynasty.
We are showing here, however, a
photograph of one of the most ancient open
burials ever discovered in Egypt. This is
accompanied by various heads of mummies,
to show the state of preservation. (See <a href="#pl5">Plate 5</a>.)
Before the art of embalming
was invented and the dead were mummified,
they were buried by intrusion in the dry
sands. You will note the perfection of the
culture of this people as depicted by the pottery
undisturbed in this grave. In contrast
to this type of burial, the mummies shown
in this same plate are no better preserved
than the earlier burial. Indeed, there is no
evidence to show that these cultures were
consecutive rather than contemporary. In
various sections of Egypt it is quite probable
that different burial customs prevailed simultaneously,
and it is a pure speculation
to say that the more primitive type of burial
is ages older than the advanced style.</p>
<p>There are many anomalies and mysteries
in this so-called stone age in Egypt. In the
museum at Cairo there will be found some of
the most remarkable specimens of stone flaking
to be seen on the face of this earth. Others
may be seen in the British Museum, in the
various exhibits of Egyptian culture. One
of these knives is equipped with two points,
and all of them are equally sharpened on both
edges. In the author&rsquo;s own gatherings from
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
the various stone cultures of mankind, there
are something over 25,000 artifacts. We have
seen every important collection of stone implements
in the present world, but these
specimens from ancient Egypt are unquestionably
the most magnificent types of stone
culture we have ever been privileged to observe.</p>
<p>The significant and startling fact is that
these stone knives have handles of beaten
gold. At once we are impressed with the
anomalous fact that the stone age was thus
synonymous with an age of metal. Furthermore,
it was an artistic age. The golden handles
on these stone weapons are engraved with
scenes common to the life of the people. On
one side of the stone dagger with the double
points, there is a sailing vessel typical of
the pleasure craft that were common to all
ages of Egyptian life. On the raised deck of
this boat, dancing maidens were entertaining
the circle of spectators. This work was
not crude and brutish, but showed a high development
of the engraver&rsquo;s art. The reverse
side of the handle was even more interesting
in that it contained, in beautifully incised
characters, the cult sign of the owner.</p>
<p>Here is, indeed, a weird super-imposition
of ages and cultures. The body of the
weapon is of a stone age; the handle of the
weapon is of an age of metal; the engravings
upon that metal show an age of art and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
possession of written characters. There is
no comfort for the evolutionary hypothesis
in the antiquity of Egypt. The contrary
rather is the case. There is a strange tide
sweeping through the record, portraying an
ebb and flow of culture that is fascinating
to observe.</p>
<p>The culture of Egypt starts on a magnificently
high level and is later reduced to a
tremendous degree by a consistent record of
degeneration. It might be said that by the
end of the fourth dynasty, the people had
reached the high peak of Egyptian art and
learning. But after the sixth dynasty had
well begun, a definite decline and retrogression
had set in. We find ourselves then groping
in a dark age wherein were no arts and
no written history. No great monuments
come from that period, and no great buildings
were begun, repaired, or finished. Writing
became extremely scarce and in many
sections of the land the art seems to have
been completely forgotten. As in the dark
ages of medieval Europe, learning was in
eclipse and the mental life of man degenerated.
Just when the renaissance began, it
is impossible to say, but in the eleventh dynasty
we are suddenly back into the light
again.</p>
<p>Egypt emerges from those dark ages, ruled
by powerful feudal lords, with the pharaohs
appearing to be mere figure-heads. These
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
great barons left voluminous records, which
depict their conquests and their powers, and
tell of their own individual greatness. They
constructed magnificent tombs for their eternal
rest, and the land blossomed culturally
under their dominion.</p>
<p>These conditions prevailed until the coming
of the Hyksos dynasty. These conquering
kings were of Semitic origin and they
seem to have come from the region of Ur.
After this conquest, Egypt suddenly became
an unlimited monarchy. The great lords became
landless, stripped of their power and
robbed of all authority. The people literally
passed into the possession of the crown, and
Egypt became a nation of slaves who owed
their very existence to the royal head of the
government. The reason for this change will
be made manifest later in this present work.
We are now interested only in presenting
these strange cycles of culture as shown by
archeology.</p>
<p>It would take many volumes to give a detailed
picture of the early golden age in
Egypt. As an illustration of the art and development
of that culture, we refer the reader
to the tomb of a court official at the dawn of
the sixth dynasty. Buried with this minor official
were certain small wooden effigies depicting
customs, trades, and tools of his day.
There were porters laden with their heavy
burdens. There were scribes bearing stylus
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
and plaque. Certain tradesmen were found in
these brilliant statuettes, each man&rsquo;s craft
being shown by the tools that he carried in
his hand. Priests appeared clad in their
pontifical robes. Perhaps the most interesting
of all were the statuettes of candy
vendors, each man equipped with his tray of
sweets, and a horsehair tail wherewith to
fan the flies. Some of these statues were
so perfect in their execution that the eminent
Phidias might well have envied their perfection.
When we compare this art and culture
with the so-called pictures of brutish
cave-dwellers, we have one more failure in
the collapsing chain of evidences that was
supposed to show man&rsquo;s constantly advancing
culture.</p>
<p>We might also give, by way of illustration,
the magnificent statue of Kephren. This
memorial was exquisitely carved from stone
so hard that it would blunt most modern
tools. Kephren constructed one of the pyramids
at Giza. This latter work was notable
in that there were evidences that some of the
stones had been cut with what appeared to
be tubular drills. Since this is possible in
our modern culture with the use of diamond-pointed
instruments, there is food for considerable
thought and speculation as to the
culture and learning of Kephren&rsquo;s age! As
a general statement, it is not too much to
say that the farther back we go into Egyptian
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
antiquity, the more perfect the arts and culture
in general seem to be.</p>
<p>When we compare, for instance, the brilliant
workmanship of the priceless pectoral
of the daughter of Usertesen (or Usertsen)
with the crude and amateurish workmanship
of the jewelry of the later queen Abhotep, it
is evident that the centuries brought retrogression.
The reign of Usertesen may be
correlated with the early period of the patriarchal
age, which fact has an important
bearing upon our study. The hopeful critics
of the Book of Genesis have postulated for
the age of Abraham a barbaric lack of culture
comparable to the nomadic tribes of
Arabia in the Middle Ages. We now see,
however, that the entire age of the patriarchs
was a period of exquisite culture and high
learning. To refer again to Usertsen, he
seems to have been a capable strategist, and
his system of working out his plan of battle
was something like the game of chess. His
artists had made for him models of the various
kinds of soldiers that made up his variegated
corps. The bowmen were armed
with exquisite miniature weapons that had,
to our delight and wonder, been preserved
against all the passing centuries. The black
troops that he used, of whatever origin, were
carved from a wood like our ebony, and the
tiny features were negroid in faithful representation
of the difference between the races
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
of men employed in his army. These model
soldiers could be moved about a board which
depicted the terrain of battle, and his strategy
thus wrought out. Our present point,
however, is the artistic perfection of the
models of the soldiers that he used. The art
of his age was as nearly perfect as one could
wish.</p>
<p>Then there came another cycle of retrogression
and decay which climaxed in a period
of cultural darkness that reigned too long
over that ancient people. It is highly significant,
for instance, that the best glass of
Egypt is dug from the more ancient sites.
There came a time when the art of making
glass was forgotten by the people of Egypt
and had later to be rediscovered by other
races.</p>
<p>If there is one voice that can be heard in
archeology, and one lesson that can be specifically
learned, it is the certainty of the
fallacy of the theory of evolution. Egypt,
as elsewhere, shows us no dim, brutish beginning,
but a startling emergence of this
people in a high degree of culture. No gradual
ascent up the ladder of learning, but
cycles of retrogression and advancement, followed
by decay: then a new dawning of art
and science. The entire record of archeology
is thus a complete vindication of the premise
and basic contention of the inspired record
of God&rsquo;s Word. No greater voice may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
heard in our day than this definite, adamant
cry from Egypt, which depicts cycles of culture
that begin with a crest of learning. It
must not be presumed that this condition is
unique in Egypt, or peculiar to any one race
or country. The same queer discrepancy between
the fallacious theories of the philosophy
of organic evolution and the facts of
human history is observed wherever archeology
has been able to hold the torch of discovery
over a given area.</p>
<p>We have illustrated, for instance, in Plates
Number <a href="#pl6">6</a> and <a href="#pl7">7</a>, one of the most interesting
of the exhibits in the British Museum. This is
a stone weapon from the archaic ages of the
Chaldeans. It consists of a mace head, made
of limestone. Incidentally, this was a very
common type of weapon among those people
in their warlike culture. The particular one
that is illustrated is typical of its time. Note
that it is a STONE AGE WEAPON.</p>
<p>A note of wonder is caused in our inquiring
minds by the odd and utterly incompatible
fact that it is engraved clearly in high relief,
thus testifying to the fact that in the
archaic stone age of Babylon, men who
wrought in a time when the evolutionary
advocates demand a dim and brutish stage
of development were already gifted in the
art of sculpture!</p>
<p>To complicate the case still further, they
were possessed as well with a highly developed
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
written language! Their stone implements
are in some instances crude, as they
did not spend time polishing and decorating
rude tools that were used for a base purpose.
Others of their artifacts, like this stone mace
head, are not only covered with finely sculptured
figures but are also inscribed with
written characters that are clear and well
executed. A &ldquo;stone age&rdquo; with a written culture,
scholars, and books, is an anomaly, indeed!</p>
<p>Where, then, in the light of these archeological
facts, is the evidence of the slow development
of the human mentality and the
emergence of primitive man from his &ldquo;brutish&rdquo;
state? Unfortunately for the high-priests
of the dying sect of organic evolution,
the science which delineates the true condition
of ancient races offers them no help or
proof whatever. The opposite is the case in
archeology, as <i>all</i> the evidence that has come
to us from the honest attempt to see man as
he was, and not as he was reported to have
been, has proved conclusively that organic
evolution is a false religion. It is inevitable
that this fact should some day come to light;
for although it may be that science moves
with leaden feet, when it does finally overtake
error, it smites with an iron fist!</p>
<p>Thus the false theory that man has struggled
upward from a valley of brutish darkness
is refuted by archeology, and the premise
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
of specific creation, as set forth in the Bible,
is established by the discoveries in the realm
of this science. In every land that man has
occupied for a long period of time, the tide
of culture has ebbed and flowed from that
hour to this present moment of writing. Just
as the night follows the day, and the next
day dawns only to be succeeded by the darkness
in turn, so the learning and progress of
man has been a cycle, rather than a steady
climb up a ladder of learning, from level to
level, until the heights of present civilization
were reached. The old error must now be
abandoned, or else we must close our eyes
to the entire record of archeological discovery,
and frankly confess that we are not interested
in facts which refute erroneous, but
accepted theories.</p>

<br />Converging Streams</h2>
<p>In a systematic presentation of the evidences
in the field of Christian apologetics,
it is necessary to review the Egyptian and
Chaldean records as they bear upon the text
of the Scripture, and illumine its meaning.
For it is here that the streams of History and
Revelation converge, to continue their flow
in mingled harmony throughout all the centuries
which follow this original conjunction.</p>
<p>In the very nature of the case we would
not expect direct archeological confirmation
of a great deal of the earlier portions of the
Old Testament. The record of creation
which was handed down from Adam to each
generation delineated an event which was
not witnessed by any human being. As has
been very clearly shown in the illuminating
book, &ldquo;New Discoveries in Babylonia about
Genesis,&rdquo; by P. J. Wiseman, this record was
undoubtedly preserved in a written form
from the very time of Adam himself.</p>

<p class="pcap">Khnum and Thoth in Creation Tradition.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The events of the Garden of Eden and the
subsequent history are not such as would
leave archeological material for the exact enlightenment
of later generations. There is,
however, a manner in which the study of
antiquity can bring a tremendous light to
shine upon the dark problem of the credibility
of these records. It is generally conceded
by ethnologists that when races of people hold
a strongly developed idea or belief, in common,
there must have been an historical incident
as the basis of that universal tradition.
Thus, among the very earliest traditions of
ancient Egypt, there is a record of the creation
of man that bears a valuable relationship
to the account in Genesis.</p>
<p>The Mosaic record states that God stooped
and created the body of man out of the dust
of the earth. Life was imparted to that body
by the very breath of God.</p>
<p>The earliest Egyptian record recounts how
the god Khnum took a slab of mud, and placing
it upon his potter&rsquo;s wheel, moulded it
into the physical form of the first man. The
illustration facing this page shows the entire
process, with Thoth standing behind Khnum,
and marking the span of man&rsquo;s years upon
a notched branch. Here then is a coincidence
of traditional belief in the manner of creation
of man that is of tremendous significance.</p>
<p>We also note that the earliest records of
Sumeria have this same incidental bearing
upon certain portions of the Old Testament
text.</p>
<p><i>All</i> of the records of antiquity begin the
history of man in a garden. This is of considerable
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
significance in view of the account
of Eden that is so prominently given in the
record of Genesis.</p>
<p>Among the seals to which we shall occasionally
refer and which are shown in <a href="#pl8">Plate 8</a>,
there is one from an early period
in Sumeria from which we have derived
considerable understanding of Sumerian beliefs.
This seal shows Adam and Eve on
opposite sides of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, and can be nothing less
than a direct reference to the event that is
recorded in the Book of Genesis.</p>
<p>One of the most constantly cited documents
of antiquity, is the so-called Gilgamesh epic.
The high antiquity of the original form in
which this occurs may be seen from the fact
that many of the seals that go as far back
as the year 3,000 B. C. are made of illustrations
of the various episodes that are contained
in this valuable document. The original
home of Gilgamesh seems to have been
at Erech. The city was evidently besieged
by an army led by Gilgamesh, who, after a
three-year war, became the king of the city.
So harsh was the despotic rule of the conquering
monarch that the people petitioned
the goddess Aruru to create a being strong
enough to overthrow Gilgamesh and release
them from his sway.</p>
<p>Some of the gods joined in with this prayer
and as a result a mythical being, partly divine,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
partly human, and partly animal, was
created and dispatched to Erech for the destruction
of Gilgamesh. This composite hero
bears a great many different names, but the
earliest accepted form in the Babylonian account
was Enkedu. Gilgamesh, learning that
an enemy had been created for his destruction,
exercised craft and lured Enkedu to the
city of Erech. The two became fast friends
and set out finally to do battle with a mighty
giant named Khumbaba. When they arrived
at his castle, they besieged and captured the
stronghold of the giant, whom they slew.
They carried off his head as a trophy and
returned to Erech to celebrate their victory.</p>
<p>The plan of the gods being thus frustrated,
the goddess Ishtar besought her father Anu
to create a mighty bull to destroy Gilgamesh.
The bull being formed and dispatched upon
its duty, also failed of its purpose when Enkedu
and Gilgamesh vanquished the animal after
a tremendous battle. And so on, the story
goes with episode after episode, culminating
with a crisis in the account of the deluge.</p>
<p>In this climax, in a notable and fascinating
manner, we see again the coincidence of
tradition with a record of the Scripture. In
the Babylonian account of the deluge, every
major premise of the Mosaic record is sustained
in its entirety. The Gilgamesh account
tells of the heavenly warning, it depicts
the gathering of material and the building
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
of an ark. In the ark was safely carried
the hero, his wife and his family with certain
beasts of the earth for seed. The ark of the
Gilgamesh episode was made water tight
with bitumen exactly as was the ark of Noah
in the record in the Book of Genesis. Entering
this ark, the Babylonian account tells
how the boat came under the direct supervision
of the gods. On the same night a
mighty torrent fell out of the skies. The
cloudburst continued for six days and nights,
until the tops of the mountains were covered.
The sea arose out of its banks and helped to
overflow the land. After the seventh day,
the storm abated and the sea decreased. By
that time, however, the whole human race
had been destroyed with the exception of
the little company who had been within the
Babylonian ark.</p>
<p>The ark of Babylon grounded in that portion
of the ancient world known as Armenia,
the Hebrew name of which is Ararat. Seven
days after the landing of the ark, the imprisoned
remnant sent forth a dove. When she
found no place to light and rest, the dove
returned to the ship. They waited a short
while and then sent forth a swallow. The
swallow also returned, wearied from a long
flight, and several more days were allowed
to elapse. The next attempt to discover the
condition of the earth by the imprisoned
remnant resulted in the sending forth of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
raven. The bird returned and approached
the ark, but refused to re-enter the ship.
The remnant knew then that the flood was
ended. They accordingly went forth with
all the redeemed life, and celebrated their
preservation by offering up sacrifices to the
gods upon the mountains.</p>
<p>The goddess Ishtar was so pleased with
the sacrifice of the godly remnant that she
hung in the heavens a great bow, which Anu,
the father of the gods, had made for the occasion.
She swore by the sacred ornaments
that hung about her neck that mankind should
not again be destroyed by a flood, and this
heavenly bow was the sign of that covenant.</p>
<p>The incidental details which are found in
this hoary manuscript coincide too closely
with the record of Genesis to admit of coincidence.
Archeology has brought no stronger
testimony to the historicity of the Mosaic
record of the deluge than this great account
in the Gilgamesh epic, although interspersed
with mythological characters and deviating
from the simplicity of the Genesis account.</p>
<p>One of the most valuable publications of
the British Museum is their monograph on
the Gilgamesh legend, which contains a fine
and scholarly translation of the deluge tablet
in an unabridged form. Our own copy of
this publication has been of great value to
many students who have sought its aid in
their detailed studies of the Old Testament.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Another one of the disputed portions of
the Old Testament text which brought great
comfort to the habitually hopeful among the
destructive critics, is that section of Genesis
which deals with the record of Nimrod and
the tower of Babel.</p>
<p>Modern archeology not only has failed to
bring any aid to the critics in this particular
incident, but has robbed them of all their
carefully erected structure of argument
which was predicated upon the assumption
that the tower of Babel was entirely mythological.
Among the recent excavations in
Mesopotamia was the work in the region
which bore the oriental name of Birs-nimroud.
When the excavators had finished
their enormous task, they had laid bare a
magnificent ziggurat of tremendous antiquity
which was the largest so far discovered. At
the time these ruins were first seen, this
enormous tower covered an area of 1,444,000
square feet. It towered to the height of a
bit more than 700 feet. Time has, of course,
ravished this monument to some extent, but
enough of its grandeur and glory remains to
show it forth as the most ancient as well as
the most magnificent of the Babylonian ziggurats.</p>
<p>According to the description given by Herodotus,
in the middle of the fifth century,
B. C., the structure then consisted of a series
of eight ascending towers, each one recessed
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
in the modern fashion of cutting-back that
is used in certain types of sky-scraper architecture.
The famous Step Pyramid at Sakkara
is another ancient example of this type
of structure, each successive and higher tower
being smaller than the one upon which
it rests. A spiral roadway, according to Herodotus,
went around the entire ziggurat,
mounting rapidly from level to level. He
states that at each level a resting place was
provided in this spiral roadway. At the top
of the structure was a magnificent temple
in which the religious exercises of the day
were observed.</p>
<p>That this was the tower of Nimrod is generally
accepted by the authorities of our present
day. The name of Nimrod which in the
Sumerian ideographs is read &ldquo;Ni-mir-rud&rdquo;
is found on a number of artifacts and records
of high antiquity, and reference is made as
well to the great monument that he built.</p>
<p>So as we <i>read</i> our way through the episodes
which constitute the earlier records of Genesis,
we also <i>dig</i> our way into the older strata
of humanity and find ourselves walking hand
in hand with the twins of revelation and scientific
vindication! They coincide in all their
utterances, teaching us that all that the Word
of God has to say to men may be accepted
without question or doubt.</p>
<p>The late Melvin Grove Kyle has written
extensively of his own researches at Sodom
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
and Gomorrah, so that it is unnecessary to
recapitulate the results of his lifetime of labor.
The sulphurous overburden and the
startling confirmation of the Book of Genesis
derived from the work of Dr. Kyle and his
associates would vindicate the Scriptural
claims to historical accuracy even if they
stood by themselves.</p>
<p>In the general argument and discussion
that long has clustered about the record of
Abraham, the starting point of critical refutation
has generally been the fourteenth chapter
of Genesis. It is stated that the battle of
the kings that occurred in this disputed portion
of Holy Writ, was in the days of Amraphel,
king of Shinar. Since a contemporary
is named as Ched-or-la-o-mer, a storm
of argument has swept over and about that
one opening verse of this important chapter.
The allies of Ched-or-la-o-mer are well known
from his own records, and Amraphel was
not to be found among them. It was a tremendous
blow to criticism when the discovery
was made that Amraphel is the Hebrew
name of the Sumerian form, Khammurabi.</p>

<p>The brilliant ability of this mighty ruler
is one of the high points of far antiquity.
The king-lists of antiquity, derived from
many sources, were compiled by order of
several of the kings of Assyria and constitute
another of the many valuable records to be
found in the British Museum. A recent publication
of the Museum entitled &ldquo;The Annals
of the Kings of Assyria&rdquo; is well worth many
times the price of one pound sterling which
is demanded for the volume. This scholarly
and brilliant piece of work contains the original
Assyrian text transliterated and translated
with historical data that the careful
scholar cannot be without. It settles the
question of Khammurabi. This Khammurabi,
whom we shall now call by his Hebrew
name Amraphel, has left us a long series of
tablets, monuments, letters, and a code of
laws which stands engraved upon a great
monument preserved also in the British Museum.</p>
<p>It is a long way back to that twentieth century
before Christ, but neither time nor distance
prevents our hearing the clamoring
voices of men long dead, who shout to us
their vindication of the nature, character,
and integrity of these testimonies which are
the Word of God!</p>
<p>It is a matter of common knowledge in our
day that the word, or name, pharaoh, may
be applied either to a person or to an office.
Exactly as our modern word &ldquo;president&rdquo; may
be applied to the function of the office, or to
the possessor of it in person, so the ruler of
Egypt could be known simply as The Pharaoh,
or shorter still, as Pharaoh. As every
president, emperor or king, however, has his
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
own proper name, so each pharaoh also is
designated by his personal name. Fortunately
for our purpose, many pharaohs are
mentioned in the pages of Holy Writ under
the clear identification of their proper names.
Many of them, however, are not identified by
their personal name but are referred to only
by the title of their kingly office. Thus, for
instance, the pharaoh of the Exodus is not
named personally in the text. Such attempts
at identification of this pharaoh as are made,
must be made from external sources. However,
there can be no question of the identity
of the rulers of Egypt, who are specifically
named in the Word of God. Such men as
the Pharaoh Shishak, the Pharaoh Zera and
the Pharaoh So, are identified beyond any
possibility of question.</p>
<p>It is a happy circumstance for the student
of apologetics that each of the pharaohs who
is so named in person by the writers of the
Bible, has been discovered and identified in
the records of archeology. No more emphatic
voice as to the credibility and the
infallible nature of the historical sections of
the Scripture can be heard than that which
is formed by the chorus of these pharaohs.</p>
<p>To note the background of this record, may
we remind the reader that in early times,
Egypt was a divided kingdom. It was known
as Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, and a separate
monarch reigned over each section. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
happens that in the period of the divided
kingdom, there were fourteen dynasties in
each section of the land. The Egyptian, like
all Eastern people, highly prized ancestral
antiquity. The farther back into antiquity
a man&rsquo;s family could be traced in his genealogy,
the more the honour that accrued to
him. We are not without modern counterparts,
even in our present democracy.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the two kingdoms were
united, the first kings of the united kingdom
added together the fourteen dynasties of
Upper and Lower Egypt, making them consecutive
instead of contiguous. Thus they
built a spurious antiquity of twenty-eight
dynasties to enhance their greatness.</p>
<p>The earlier archeologists fell into this trap,
and consequently erected an antiquity phantom
which obscured the problem of chronology
for some considerable time. When it
was discovered that these dynasties were concurrent,
a great deal of the fallacious antiquity
of Egypt was abandoned. This fictional
antiquity, which doubled the factor of
time for that period, had been used to discredit
the text of the Bible by the critical
scholars, so-called. Now, in the light of our
present learning, we find no discrepancy between
the antiquity of Egypt, properly understood,
and the chronology of the Scripture,
when it is divorced from the errors of
Ussher. Incidentally, the chronology and
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
antiquity demands of both archeology and
revelation coincide beautifully with the demands
of sane anthropology.</p>
<p>To delineate this background so necessary
to the proper understanding of the record
of the pharaohs, it is necessary to introduce
the first occasion of the coincidence of the
text of the Scripture with the land and the
people of Egypt, as it is here that the streams
of revelation and history begin to converge.
This beginning is made, of course, in the
flight of Abraham into Egypt at the time
of a disastrous famine. Overlooking for the
moment the reprehensible conduct of Abraham
concerning the denial of his wife Sarah,
and the consequent embarrassment of the
pharaoh, we digress to make a brief survey
of the incidents that lead up to the kindness
of Pharaoh to Abraham.</p>
<p>There had been previous Semitic invasions
of Egypt. The first reason for these forays,
of course, was famine. Due to the unfailing
inundation by the river Nile, the fertile land
of Egypt was a natural storehouse. The land
of Egypt is fertile, the sun is benevolent, and
wherever water reaches the land, amazingly
prodigious crops are the inevitable result. So
in the ancient days, whenever there was
drought in the desert countries surrounding
Egypt, the hungry hordes looked on the food
supplies of their neighboring country, and,
naturally, moved in that direction. Thus
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
the pressure of want was the primary reason
for these early Semitic invasions.</p>
<p>The secondary cause was conquest. These
people of antiquity were brutal pragmatists,
as are certain nations in our present Twentieth
Century. The theme song of antiquity
undoubtedly was, &ldquo;I came, I saw, I conquered.&rdquo;
The motive for living in those stern
days seems to have been, &ldquo;He takes who can,
and keeps who may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The activating motive of much past history
is simply <i>spoils</i>. Here now is a case in
point. A family of kings ruled in Syria, who
counted their wealth by flocks and herds.
Driven by a combination of circumstances,
they descended upon Egypt. They were
pressed by the lack of forage in their own
land, due to the drought, and they also lusted
after the treasure and wealth of the neighboring
country. So, without need for any
other excuse, they descended with their
armed hordes and conquered Egypt. There
they ruled, established a dynasty and possessed
the land for themselves. Since their
principal possessions were their flocks and
herds, they were known as the Shepherd
Kings. They have come down in history as
the Hyksos Dynasty. They unified Syria
and Egypt, and it is intriguing to study the
development of this unification as that process
is seen in the pottery of that period. The
work of Egyptian artisans began to take on
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
certain characteristics of Syrian culture until,
finally, the characteristic Egyptian line
and decoration disappeared and the pottery
became purely Syrian. The Shepherd Kings
established commerce between the two halves
of their empire and prosperity followed their
conquest. These kings imported artists from
their native Syria, together with musicians
and dancers innumerable.</p>
<p>This intrusion of a foreign culture so
changed the standards of Egypt that for
generations the ideal of beauty was a Syrian
ideal. Later, when the Syrian kings were
expelled by Tahutmas the 2nd, the situation
was reversed and Egypt, now governed by
an Egyptian, kept Syria as her share of the
spoils.</p>
<p>Four hundred years later another Semitic
invasion swept over the land from Ur. It
is quite probable that these conquerors were
Sumerians. They established the sixteenth
dynasty and brought with them also their
treasure in the form of livestock. Thus,
when Abraham entered Egypt, he found that
it was ruled by his relatives! Thus we have
an explanation of the cordial welcome that a
Sumerian from Ur received from a pharaoh
in Egypt. This contact is well established
through the arts of that day, by pottery, by
frescoes, and by means of the records of
ancient customs. We know these things to be
facts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>So when we read of the record of Abraham,
we have at our disposal a vast and overwhelming
source of evidence as to the credibility
of this section of the record. The
statements that are made in Genesis could
have been written only by one who was
intimately familiar with the Egypt of that
day and time.</p>
<p>The second contact of Egypt and the Genesis
record is found in the experience of Joseph.
Although harsh and unkind, the action
of the brothers in selling the youngest
into slavery was perfectly legal under the
code of that day. The younger brethren were
all subject to the elders, and the law of primogeniture
gave to the elder almost unlimited
power over the life of the younger. The
brutality and envy of this act are far from
unparalleled in the secular records of that
day. Nor was Joseph&rsquo;s phenomenal rise to
power unusual in the strange culture of that
day and time. We must remember that Joseph
was a Semite at a Semitic court. There
is an unconscious introduction of a collateral
fact in the simple statement of Genesis, chapter
thirty-nine, verse one. After being told
that Joseph was sold to a man named Potiphar,
the statement is made that Potiphar
was an Egyptian.</p>
<p>At first thought it would seem to be expected
that a trusted officer in the court of
a pharaoh would naturally be an Egyptian.
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
The contrary is the case here, however. The
pharaoh himself being an invader, he had
surrounded himself with trusted men of his
own race and family. As far as may now be
ascertained, Potiphar was the only Egyptian
who had preserved his life and kept his place
at the court. He seems to have been the
chief officer of the bodyguard of Pharaoh,
and as such was entrusted with the dubious
honor of executing the Pharaoh&rsquo;s personal
enemies. This, then, is a simple and passing
statement that gives us an unexpected means
of checking the scrupulous accuracy of the
Genesis record.</p>
<p>Joseph was comely, attractive, and faithful.
With an optimistic acceptance of his
unfortunate circumstances, which seem much
harder to us in our enlightened generation
than would actually be the case to one accustomed
to such vicissitudes of fortune, he
set himself to serve with fidelity and industry.
But above all this, the blessing of God
rested upon him and upon all that he did.
Since he was in the line of the promised
Seed, and was under the direct blessing of
that promise, it was inevitable that he should
prosper.</p>
<p>There is a flood of illumination that shines
upon this period from the frescoed tombs,
the ancient papyri, and the records crudely
inscribed upon walls and pillars. Particularly
is this true of the entire section of Genesis
that begins with the fortieth chapter
and continues to the end of that Book.</p>

<p>Among the quaint frescoes of antiquity,
there is one that has no word of explanation.
There are many such murals in Egyptian
tombs, and the cattle also figure often in the
pictures on the papyri. (See <a href="#pl9">Plate 9</a>.)
This fresco, however, was quite unique.
Across the scene there parade fourteen cattle.
The first seven are round, fat and in fine condition.
They are followed by seven of the
skinniest cows that ever ambled on four legs!
No word of explanation is needed to clarify
this scene for those who are familiar with
the history of that time.</p>
<p>There is another mural showing the chief
baker of Pharaoh, followed by his servants
and porters. In his hand he holds a receipt
for the one hundred thousand loaves that
were daily delivered to the palace of Pharaoh.
These &ldquo;loaves&rdquo; were in the nature of large
buns.</p>
<p>The multiplicity of these paintings would
require a volume to delineate carefully, but
there is information here that cannot be
passed over in silence. They bring to us
the solution of one of those mysteries of
Egyptian history, which is found in the collapse
of the feudal system and the consequent
complete possession of the land by the crown.
We can now read from the secular evidences
thus derived, that in a time of plenty a
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
trusted lieutenant of the king built granaries
to store the surplus left over from the
time of plenty. Of course, to our enlightened
times or in the culture of this generation, that
is the height of ignorance. The proper thing
to do in a time plenty is to <i>destroy</i> the surplus
and plow under the excess. We sometimes
wonder what would have happened in
Egypt if our modern culture had prevailed
in the seven years of plenty, in the light of
the famine that followed!</p>
<p>We now find that when the whole land
hungered, the lords ceded their real estate
to the crown for grain to keep themselves
and their families alive. The people sold
themselves to Pharaoh and became slaves,
on condition that he feed them as he would
his cattle. When this time of famine was
ended, Egypt was so absolute a monarchy
that Pharaoh owned even the bodies of those
who had been his subjects.</p>
<p>As an illuminating collateral incident, we
now learn that a Sumerian name was given
to Joseph, the trusted lieutenant. To him
was accorded the title &ldquo;Zaph-nath-pa-a-ne-ah.&rdquo;
The Sumerian meaning is &ldquo;Master of
hidden learning,&rdquo; and was a title of honour
and distinction which was conferred because
of his wisdom and forethought in providing
for the future. To him also was accorded the
royal honour. He was to be preceded by a
herald who called upon the people to bow
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
down as Joseph passed by. Herein there
comes the explanation of a slight philological
difficulty in the text of Genesis. They have
tried to make this title of honour to mean
&ldquo;Little Father.&rdquo; This difficulty, however,
disappears when we understand that it is
not a Hebrew word that is found in the
text, but an ancient Egyptian phrase. The
common form of the word is &ldquo;Ah-brak&rdquo; and
literally it means &ldquo;bending the knee.&rdquo; The
Babylonian form of the word is &ldquo;Abarakhu.&rdquo;
In some parts of the ancient world the term
&ldquo;Ah-brak&rdquo; is still used by cameliers to make
their beasts of burden kneel to receive their
load. Thus when Joseph, the master of the
hidden learning, went abroad throughout the
land the herald preceded him crying, &ldquo;Bend
the knee,&rdquo; and all the populace bowed in
homage to him in acknowledgment of his
distinguished accomplishments.</p>
<p>Against this background of understanding,
we now turn our thoughts to one of the most
stirring dramas in all human history. Again
there was a famine in the entire land of
Sumeria, and the people turned, as was customary,
to the land of Egypt for succor and
relief. Had this epic been invented by
some literary genius of antiquity, the arrival
of the brothers of Joseph to buy grain for
their starving clan would be deemed one
of the most melodramatic episodes ever conceived
by the human mind. Therein we see
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
again how God overruled the evil deed of
the brethren, and by that very deed saved
the guilty. In a time of world oppression
and bitter famine, the family of Abraham
was reunited in the shelter of Egypt.</p>
<p>As the story unfolds, we see the significance
of Joseph&rsquo;s instructions to his brethren.
These Semitic kings were shepherds who
highly prized their flocks and herds. The
Egyptians, however, despised husbandry, and
thus the monarchs were in great distress because
of the want of capable herdsmen. The
brethren of Joseph were distantly related to
the reigning pharaoh. They were of the
same race of people, and their father Abraham
had been a prince in that land of Sumeria.
So when the pharaoh asked them
what their occupation was, recognizing them
as distant relatives, they were canny enough
to reply, &ldquo;We be shepherds; to sojourn in the
land are we come.&rdquo; With great delight, the
pharaoh employed them to be the personal
overseers of his treasured animals.</p>
<p>Goshen, which consisted of two hundred
square miles of fertility, and was the finest
province and the juiciest plum in Egypt, was
turned over to them for a pasture! They
entered into a life of comparative ease, of
absolute security, and of importance in the
court of their day.</p>
<p>So there came into Egypt that group which
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
was to constitute the spring that gave rise
to the historic stream of the Hebrew people.
The tribes were there in the persons of their
founders, and the long contact of Israel and
Egypt began through the pressure and want
occasioned by a time of famine.</p>
<p>One further interesting and collateral evidence
of the accuracy of these records is
found in the various texts and sections of
the Books of the Dead, and in the records of
the customs and practices of the ancient art
of embalming. In Egypt the general rule
was to allow seventy days for the embalming
of a dead body, the burial, and the mourning
for the dead. But the fiftieth chapter of
Genesis dealing with the death and burial
of Joseph tells us, in the third verse, &ldquo;And
<i>forty</i> days were fulfilled for him; for so are
fulfilled the days of those <i>which are embalmed</i>:
and the Egyptians <i>mourned</i> for him
<i>threescore and ten days</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These statements could be true only in the
days of a Hyksos or Sumerian dynasty. The
manner of embalming introduced by these
Syrian conquerors, required forty days for
the complete process and the burial. Seventy
days was their custom for mourning, thus
making a total of one hundred ten days. Only
in these exact periods of Egyptian history
could this record of Genesis be thus established
and accredited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>It is a fascinating experience for the student
of archeology to wend his way through
the mass of evidence derived from these generations
and now in the possession of the
great museums of our earth. A pilgrimage
begun in the British Museum, at London, continuing
through the Egyptian Museum at
Cairo, passing by way of Sakkara to culminate
at Karnak, will enable the fascinated
student to read this entire book of Genesis
from the sources of antiquity. Thus in the
very beginning of the convergence of the two
streams, Revelation and History, we see that
dead men <i>indeed</i> tell tales; and their stories
vindicate the record of the Word of God!</p>
<p>Much of this evidence is, in the very nature
of the case, inductive, and is valuable largely
because of the light it sheds on dark places
in the text of the Scripture. The customs of
the people of antiquity were in many ways
so different from those of our day, we have
lost the comprehension of their conduct that
is dependent upon mutual experience. There
are thus certain obscurities in the pages of
the Bible that have baffled modern man for
a long time, but which are now clearly understood
in the light of fresh understanding
of the beliefs and practices of the times that
are dealt with in the Scriptures. This is by
no means the least of the benefits of archeological
investigation.</p>
<p>One such field will be found in the record
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
of the exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt,
and the manner in which God shook the power
of the conquering pharaoh and devastated
Egypt for the relief of the oppressed. The
entire record has been repudiated point by
point by the various critics and the varying
schools of criticism, until their limited
opinions leave no grounds for belief in the
very fact of the event itself. These objections,
when analyzed carefully, are all predicated
upon the personal ignorance of the
individual critic concerning some phase of
the proceedings that climaxed with the departure
of Israel from servitude.</p>
<p>One of the commonest objections to the
credibility of the Old Testament history was
the oft-repeated assertion that though the
children of Israel were in bondage for a long
period in Egypt and left that land in the most
dramatic exodus antiquity had known, there
is no record from Egyptian sources of the people
or history of Israel. Such is not now the
case, but had it been so this would not necessarily
have diminished the value of the historical
statements to be found in the record
of the book of Exodus.</p>
<p>Very few of the races of antiquity recorded
in detail their defeats! Certainly no nation
that prided itself upon its greatness and power
ever suffered a more complete overthrow
than did Egypt in the redemption of Israel.
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
It is only natural to presume that they would
make very little reference to the crushing
blow that they suffered at that time. There
is even today a strong tendency on the part
of the Egyptians to hush up all evidence of
this event as far as it is possible to do so. In
the great Egyptian Museum at Cairo, for instance,
we find a record of one of these texts
that does refer to the Israelites.</p>
<p>Exhibit 599 in this aforesaid Museum is a
large stele in dark gray granite, which is
beautifully engraved on both sides. On one
side there is an extensive inscription in which
Amenophis the Third gives a categorical list
of his gifts and offerings for the temple of
Amon. The other side of the stele has been
appropriated by Amenpthah. He gives a
highly dramatic account of his battles and
victories over the Libyans, and then alludes
to the assault of Ascalon, of Gezer, and of
Yanoem in Palestine. In the course of this
later record, the inscription reads, &ldquo;Israel is
crushed. It has no more seed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Egyptian Museum this exhibit is accompanied
by the following ingenious statement:
&ldquo;This is the sole mention of the Israelites
in the Egyptian texts known up to the
present day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not exactly the truth. The Egyptian
Museum itself at Cairo has a number of
the tablets containing the correspondence between
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
the Egyptian court and the kings and
governors who were vassals to Egypt in Palestine
and Syria. These communications
make urgent demands upon the crown of
Egypt for military help against the invasion
of an armed horde who are called in the text,
Hebiru. The word &ldquo;Hebiru&rdquo; is commonly
identified with the modern term Hebrew.</p>
<p>Again, the late Director General of the Department
of Antiquity of Egypt and the great
founder of the Cairo Museum, Maspero, has
left us an interesting note of this monument
of Menepthah. Maspero points to the fact
that in comparison to Egypt, Chaldea and
Assyria, Israel was a very insignificant race.
If this was true when the nation was ruled
by her greatest and most glorious dynasty,
that of David and Solomon, it would be more
so when the nation consisted of a slave company
lodged in a corner of the delta.</p>
<p>The later ravages undergone by the temples
of Egypt, when they suffered incalculable
harm through the vandalism of the
darker ages, makes it indeed extraordinary
that <i>any</i> record of those earlier times has
remained.</p>
<p>In the very nature of the case, these details
could not have been comprehended by
the scholars of the past generation, as they
dealt with customs and ideas that were lost
to our age. The insatiable curiosity of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
archeologist, combined with the care with
which the Egyptians preserved their records,
can be credited with the recovery of this lost
information, the possession of which so wonderfully
establishes our faith in this more
enlightened age.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />The Ten Plagues</h2>
<p>The prosecutors of the old charge of &ldquo;folklore
and mythology&rdquo; so constantly directed
against the faith of those who hold to the
credibility of our present Scripture text,
found some of their keenest shafts in the Biblical
account of the exodus from Egypt.
Scrutinizing the record of that notable event
under the microscope of prejudice, the critics
claimed to have found many outstanding
weaknesses in the text. Particularly was
this so in that section of the story which
dealt with the plagues with which Almighty
God smote the land and broke down the
resistance of Pharaoh.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, a manifestation of a
sardonic humor in the present situation. After
denying for generations that these plagues
ever occurred, the critics now seek to rob
the account of any value by their new technique
of acquiescence. The really modern
method of discrediting the Scripture is to
admit that there is some truth in the record
and then subtly twist the meaning of the text
out of all harmony with the general plan of
revelation. As a noteworthy example of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
modern technique of criticism, we submit a
leading article which appeared in the <i>London
Express</i> of Sunday, September 6, 1936.</p>
<p>Professing to accept the historical record
of the ten plagues, the writer of this article
then craftily proceeds to offer a peculiarly
human and mechanistic theory to account for
the disaster. In reading this news item, we
are at once struck by the fact that every
element of a supernatural nature is deleted
from the strange series of events, and the
credit for the entire victory of Israel is
ascribed to the human genius of the man
Moses. This news item appeared in the following
form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="large">THE PLAGUES OF EGYPT</span>
<br />SHOW THAT MOSES ANTICIPATED BY 3,000 YEARS THE GREATEST FEAR OF MODERN SCIENCE</p>
<p>Science has been inquiring
into one of the greatest
catastrophes that befell
a nation&mdash;the ten
plagues of Egypt.</p>
<p>They have found that
modern theories are in accord
with the Bible story.</p>
<p>The plagues were
brought upon the Egyptians
by Moses in the days
of Israel&rsquo;s captivity. Dr.
Charles J. Brim, a New
York authority on public
health, says that Moses
must have anticipated by
3,000 years modern science&rsquo;s
greatest fear&mdash;the
use of disease germs, water
pollution and other attacks
on sanitation as war
weapons&mdash;in short, bacteriological
warfare.</p>
<p>Moses, states Dr. Brim,
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
in addition to being the
founder of the science of
hygiene, showed that germ
warfare could annihilate
man and beast more effectively
than arms and
man power. With it he
bent the mighty Egyptians
to his will and thus
brought about the Exodus,
the release of the Israelites
from Egyptian slavery.
With it he so undermined
their man power and morale
that it became impossible
for them to face the
hardships of war.</p>
<p>The ten plagues, in their
order, were:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Changing the water into blood;</p>
<p class="t0">The frogs;</p>
<p class="t0">The lice;</p>
<p class="t0">The flies;</p>
<p class="t0">The murrain of cattle;</p>
<p class="t0">The boils on the Egyptians;</p>
<p class="t0">Hail;</p>
<p class="t0">The locusts;</p>
<p class="t0">The darkness;</p>
<p class="t0">The death of the first-born.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first step in this
carefully planned attack,&rdquo;
says Dr. Brim in a newly
published book, &ldquo;Medicine
in the Bible,&rdquo; &ldquo;was the
pollution of Egypt&rsquo;s water
supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This had two results:
First, it attacked the god
of Egypt&mdash;the Nile; secondly,
it sapped the very
fountain of the country.</p>
<p>Egyptian legend said
that the Nile sprang from
the blood of the god Osiris.
Hence, &ldquo;the waters of the
Nile were turned into
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Egypt depended on the
Nile for its drinking water,
on its yearly inundations
for the irrigation of
the fields.</p>
<p>A polluted Nile was a
smashing blow at the water
supply and at the
crops and cattle. Nobody
could wash or drink.</p>
<p>The fish&mdash;one of the
staple foods&mdash;died. Frogs
were forced to leave their
natural haunts in the river
banks and invaded the
streets, fields and houses
in their millions.</p>
<p>Swarms of frogs, with
no water or food, died and
rotted over the countryside.
Cartloads were burned,
but not before the
germs of pollution had
time to multiply.</p>
<p>The air became filled
with the disease germs
bred in this ideal forcing-ground.
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
People and animals
became infected.</p>
<p>Flies descended in
swarms greater than people
had ever seen, bringing
more germs with them.
Cattle died in their thousands.</p>
<p>Dust, in a naturally
dusty country, became infected,
spreading more
disease and death. Nature
took a turn. A terrific
hailstorm shrieked over
Egypt. The few crops
that were left standing
were flattened and destroyed.
Animals were
killed by the force of the
hailstones. Next came the
locusts, dropping in their
millions on the fields, eating
everything the hail
had left.</p>
<p>When they passed, a
dust storm, caused probably
by the hot, electrical
wind known as the hamsin,
blew up and darkened
the sky for days on
end, as sandstorms still do
in that part of the world.
The tenth and last plague,
the death of the first-born,
was a natural consequence
of all that had happened
since the day the water
became polluted.</p>
<p>The Bible does not say
explicitly that only the
first-born died in this
plague.</p>
<p>What it does say is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it came to pass that
at midnight the Lord
smote all the first-born
in the land of Egypt,
from the first-born of
Pharaoh that sat on his
throne to the first-born
of the captive that was
in the dungeon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The epidemic killed
many others, but in the
death of the first-born lay
the greatest calamity, for
the first-born son was
chief in every Egyptian
household.</p>
<p>Dr. Brim does not explain
how the first plague
was brought about, but if
Moses did pollute the Nile
it must have been done
when the water was low.</p>
<p>It is certain that Moses
was a medical genius, as
his laws of health prove,
and knew the certain effects
of water pollution.</p>
<p>Neither does the doctor
explain how Moses foresaw
the hail, but it is
possible he could judge
atmospheric conditions
with precision.&mdash;V. B.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>It is perhaps an inaccuracy to talk about
&ldquo;modern&rdquo; attempts to thwart and deny the
Word of God! There is nothing modern about
this entire propaganda, popular as it may be
in our own day. The error is ancient, as is
the attitude of mind that would set aside
the element of the supernatural in Holy Writ,
and oppose the time-honored revelation of
God&rsquo;s will by the modern self-satisfaction
with human learning. Indeed, this common
and basic sin of our generation is so far from
being modern, that the very first recorded
case of denial of God&rsquo;s Word comes from the
Garden of Eden, man&rsquo;s first and original
home.</p>
<p>Even before sin had reared its ugly head,
to shatter the sweet communion and spoil
the fair harmony that was the basis of man&rsquo;s
fellowship with his Creator, this error appeared.
It was Satan who, encroaching upon
the beauty of Eden&rsquo;s fair content, first said,
&ldquo;Hath God said?&rdquo; The denial of the truth
of God&rsquo;s spoken word originated with the
enemy of man: and it would behoove us all
to remember that any man who has questioned
His written word from that hour to
this, is also an enemy, and an emissary of the
original foe of mankind! Do we owe Satan
so great a debt of gratitude for the deep and
dark pit of woe into which he has lured our
race, that we must lend slavish attention to
the same old error when he sponsors it today?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>For this &ldquo;modern&rdquo; attempt to discredit the
Scripture is but a recrudescence of his ancient
and simple strategy for the hurt of mankind.
Well does he know that if he can but shake
the faith of our generation in the integrity of
the Bible, faith in God must soon be lost as
well. Once more pedantic scoffers, professors
of this and of that, arise solemnly to
refute the truth of the only &ldquo;map&rdquo; that can
ever guide men back to the Paradise we lost
when the first man rejected God&rsquo;s revelation.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see that this old error
is in no new guise, in the article referred to
above. This is nothing new, it is just an
original approach to the same old mess of
Satanic whispering. Indeed, Paul warned us
of the possibility of this very article and
method in II Timothy 3:8, when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses,
so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt
minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He introduces the very age of Egyptian history,
and the events connected with the Exodus
in speaking thus of the false teachers
of the apostate days that should precede the
time of our Lord&rsquo;s return. And lo! the
event transpires in this year of grace, as the
press of the twentieth century casts doubt
upon the Ten Plagues in this subtle manner.</p>
<p>It <i>is</i> subtle. Also dishonest to the nth degree.
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
Professing to accept the historicity
of the events, the article then proceeds to
demolish the credibility of the record, by
ascribing all the plagues to natural forces,
directed by the genius of a human being,
namely, Moses. God is ruled out, the supernatural
denied, and common sense prostituted
to infidelity in a manner that the shallowest
thinker could not countenance. For
a man of medicine, or a scholar in any realm
of science, to foster such a contemptible
evasion of plain fact, passes understanding.</p>
<p>A few years ago it was customary for
criticism to deny that these plagues ever
happened. Classifying them among the reputed
folklore of the Hebrews, and relegating
them to the realm of the purely mythological,
the critic calmly and boldly denied that they
ever occurred at all. But these past years
of research and study have so established the
historicity of the record, that this procedure
is no longer possible; so the new attack is
made, on the basis of naturalism.</p>
<p>It is plainly stated that Moses himself
brought about these plagues upon the Egyptians,
and that he did so by the use of his
own superior knowledge. In a word, he was
a bacteriologist, three and a half thousand
years before Pasteur! That in itself is a
greater miracle than the plagues could ever
have been! No microscope, no instruments
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
of research, yet he not only anticipated the
discoveries of Lister and Pasteur, but he also
applied <i>germ warfare</i> to the redemption of
Israel, and &ldquo;bent the Egyptians to <i>his</i> will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More marvelous than all this, he did it by
simply polluting the Nile River, the source
of the life of Egypt. This of course was a
simple task! The Nile is a mighty river.
If we follow its course just from the First
Cataract at Assuan to the mouth, it is over
five hundred miles as the river twists and
bends round and about.</p>
<p>Now all Moses had to do was to impregnate
those five hundred miles of winding river
with some deadly form of disease germs, that
would affect the Egyptians <i>but not the Israelites</i>!
Any nice germ would do! Of course,
he had also to <i>keep</i> those five hundred miles
of flowing stream polluted, in spite of the
rushing current that swept fresh water down
day by day! Let us not forget, <i>that he did all
this while Pharaoh was looking on</i>: and that
for seven days the condition continued, then
to end as suddenly as it had begun. We
should like to know something of his technique!</p>
<p>Then, after the river had cleared its waters,
Moses boldly announced that the Lord would
overrun the land with frogs! This was done,
not as a result of a polluted river, but rather
after the river was clear. Pollution with
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
disease germs might have driven the frogs
out of the river: but how did Moses get them
to go <i>back</i>, as Pharaoh entreated him to do?</p>
<p>Most conveniently, the author of the above
cited article does not mention how the lice
were spread over the land by Moses! Did
he personally catch them and spread them all
around, or had he been breeding and storing
them for years in advance? The flies may
have increased in the rotting piles of frogs,
but what kept this pest of flies out of the
small section of Egypt called the Land of
Goshen, where the children of Israel were?
Given the conditions that caused the flies to
breed, why did they refrain from the particular
portion of the land where Moses and
his people were camping?</p>
<p>So also for the murrain on the cattle, and
the boils on the Egyptians. None of Israel
were affected by these disasters. Did Moses
have some kind of salve or prophylactic
serum that he used, he being the great medical
genius that this article makes him to be?
Even that will not account for the fact that
when the hail came, it, also, avoided the
camp of Moses and his three and a half
million compatriots!</p>
<p>But even a great medical genius and an
accomplished meteorologist could not have
foreseen the coming of the locusts that darkened
the sky and the land as well. Nor
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
could this great medical genius, even had
he also been an able entomologist, have seen
to it that the locusts ate only Egyptian vegetation,
as Goshen greenery would have been
just as acceptable to <i>hungry</i> locusts! And
who ever saw any other kind?</p>
<p>Passing over the supernatural darkness
with the simple observation that it was <i>not</i>
an ordinary phenomenon such as a sandstorm
(which left the houses of the Israelites
unaffected), we will hasten to the conclusion
of the matter, the death of the first-born.
The article we are quoting makes a terribly
strained attempt to prove that others died as
well as the first-born, but the text of the
Scripture does not so state or imply. Indeed,
the text very clearly sets forth the fact that
it was only the first-born who died. They
died dramatically; all at the same hour.</p>
<p>At midnight, simultaneously, death smote
a certain restricted class.</p>
<p>The prince in the palace, and the felon in
the dungeon; the cattle as well.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>But the first-born of Israel did not die!</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>They were all under the blood!</i></p>
</div>
<p>Quaint epidemic, was it not? It came as a
result of disease germs in the river Nile, it
killed all its victims out of just one class, the
first-born, and it passed over any home that
had lamb&rsquo;s blood on the door posts!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Is it necessary for a man to believe such arrant
nonsense, and accept such utterances
of folly before he can qualify as an educated
man, or a scientist?</p>
<p>Most fortunately, it is not!</p>
<p>To show the truth of this matter, we can
indeed study these ten plagues in the light
of modern science. Not by the flickering
rays of the lamp of human speculation can
understanding be achieved. Only in the
full illumination of the sunshine of historical
fact can the truth be discerned. So, we will
turn to the great and truly modern science
of archeology to study the Ten Plagues of
Egypt, and see what the truth of the matter
really is.</p>
<p>In the first place, thanks to the vast amount
of research in the archeology of Egypt, we
now know that these ten plagues were a
contest between the Lord God of the Israelites,
and the pantheon of Egypt.</p>
<p>The genesis of the contest is given in
Exodus 3:18. Here Moses is instructed by
God to ask Pharaoh for a three-day furlough
for the entire company of the Twelve Tribes,
that they might go three days&rsquo; journey into
the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah.
This initial request was to be the first step
in a campaign that would result in the redemption
of Israel from their long bondage,
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
and the apparently reasonable request was
made with the certainty that it would be
refused. Indeed, the request was such that
Pharaoh <i>could not grant it</i>!</p>
<p>As we shall later see, the Egyptians were
the most polytheistic nation that ever lived.
In their pantheon of deities there were more
than twenty-two hundred gods and goddesses,
and each of them had a particular theophany.
That is to say, these gods and goddesses
had certain animals that were sacred
to them, and in which animal form the particular
god or goddess occasionally manifested
a personal presence. So very often
the deities of Egypt are depicted in stone
and painting as having a human body, but
an animal head. Thus Thoth might be seen
with the head of an ibis, while Hathor sometimes
has a human head, but more often she
is portrayed with the head of a cow.</p>
<p>So there was no animal that the Hebrews
could sacrifice to their God, Jehovah, that
would not be sacred to some Egyptian deity.
This sacrifice would constitute blasphemy
in the eyes of the Egyptian masters, and
trouble would eventuate immediately! Indeed,
when Pharaoh, worn out by the troubles
brought upon him by the plagues, suggested
to Moses that the people sacrifice to
Jehovah without going to the wilderness,
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
Moses simply replied in the language that
is recorded in Exodus 8:26:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we sacrifice, that will not be an
abomination in the eyes of the Egyptians?
Will they not stone the people if they sacrifice
in the land?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The justice of the reply was so self-apparent
that the ruler did not press his suggestion,
as the text shows. Thus God forced
the issue and provoked the conflict that not
only freed His people from slavery and eventually
established them in the land that He
had promised them through Abraham, but
also showed His supremacy over the gods of
Egypt. Even more than that, in the resultant
series of events, the Lord God brought
such glory to His own Name, and showed
such omnipotence that the world has never
forgotten this drama, even to our own day
and time. Witness the very article that is
the subject of this present comment!</p>
<p>The clear statement of God&rsquo;s attitude toward
the conflict is seen in Exodus 4:23, 24.
The figure of speech used there is a divine
choice, therefore we use it just as God Himself
expressed His own mind to Moses. The
&ldquo;first-born&rdquo; was the chief object of interest
in every Egyptian household, for two reasons.
The law of primogeniture ruled in that day
and land, even as it does in England and other
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
countries today. Also, the first-born of every
species, animal or human, was dedicated to
the gods, and was a sacred object, in a very
strong sense of that word. So later, we hear
the law of Israel as set forth by God, that
the first-born of man or beast in the land is
to be sacred to Jehovah: <i>not</i> to the gods of
Egypt.</p>
<p>Now then, as Moses was sent to Pharaoh,
to carry the demands of God for the release
of the people, he was instructed to tell the
ruler that Israel was, in God&rsquo;s sight, as
prized and beloved a group as the &ldquo;first-born&rdquo;
was in an Egyptian household. In a
figure of speech that Egypt as a whole could
most clearly grasp, God said: &ldquo;Israel is <i>My</i>
son, <i>My first-born</i>: And I have said unto thee,
Let my son go that he may serve me; and
thou hast refused to let him go; behold, I will
slay <i>thy</i> son, <i>thy</i> first-born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this introduction, we can see clearly
the genesis of the conflict. It is most clearly
stated in Exodus 5:1-3. When Moses said
to Pharaoh, &ldquo;Thus saith Jehovah, the God
of Israel, Let my people go, that they may
hold a feast unto Me in the <i>wilderness</i>:&rdquo;
the ruler of the land said, in just so
many words, &ldquo;Who is Jehovah? I never
heard of him!&rdquo; Not only did the mighty king
reject the word and the commands of God,
but he also denied Him in no uncertain terms.
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
This upstart Jehovah, who was <i>He</i> to give
orders to Pharaoh the mighty? He was the
god of an humbled and captive people, therefore
the king reasoned that his own gods
must be far mightier! So the proud and
haughty monarch said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick by the gods
of Egypt; I know not this Jehovah, and I
will not obey His words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moses left with the clearly expressed warning
that the king might not then know Jehovah,
but that he was certainly destined
to find out about Him! The call to arms,
the challenge to combat, and the prophecy of
God&rsquo;s victory are all expressed in the single
verse in Exodus the seventh chapter, where
God tells Moses that &ldquo;the Egyptians shall
know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch out
my hand upon Egypt....&rdquo; This, then, was
the primary reason for the ten plagues. God
would teach the Egyptians a lesson through
<i>judgments</i> that the land would never forget!
When he finished with them, none were ever
again able to say, &ldquo;And who is this Jehovah?
The gods of Egypt are stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus we see that the contest was primarily
between the monotheism of Israel and polytheism
of Egypt. We would emphasize the
fact that the Egyptians were perhaps the
most polytheistic race the world has so far
known. It is impossible to say just how many
deities existed to the Egyptian mind, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
&ldquo;their name was legion&rdquo;! Two hundred separate
deities are named in the Pyramid Text,
and four hundred and eighty more are named
in the Theban Recension of the Book of the
Dead. Altogether, archeologists have recovered
the names of over two thousand two
hundred different gods and goddesses that
were worshipped by the Egyptians! Is it any
wonder that Jehovah must start His laws to
His people with the commandment: &ldquo;Thou
shalt have no other <i>gods</i> before me!&rdquo;?</p>
<p>A word about these objects of Egyptian
worship will be necessary to clear up the
necessary later references to the practices
and the beliefs of the Egyptians. While these
ancient folks never had the idea of an immanent,
pervasive God, in the monotheistic
sense, they still had a dim conception of a
super-god principle, behind and over the
various individual gods and goddesses. There
was first of all the grouping of gods into
triads, which was a widely accepted custom.
Since each triad consisted of a god, a wife,
and a son, this grouping is less a degeneration
of the principle of the Trinity than might
seem to be suggested at first thought. Rather,
it was a glorification of the <i>family</i> principle.</p>
<p>Thus we see that at Thebes, the principal
triad of deities consists of Amon-Ra, the king
of all the gods, Mut, his Wife, and Khons, their
son.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Ba-neb-Ded, with his wife Het-mehit, and
their son Harpakhrad (whom the Greeks later
called Harpokrates) constituted the triad
at Mendes. In like manner, the Memphis
triad was composed of Ptah, Sekhmet, and
Imhotep. Sometimes the greater gods were
grouped into a company of nine, called the
Ennead. There was also the grouping of
the major deities into the &ldquo;Three Companies,&rdquo;
being the gods of the heaven, the earth,
and the Other or Under World.</p>
<p>All the gods had human bodies, but some
of them had animal heads. Sometimes a god
who customarily had a human head would
appear wearing the animal head of his theophany,
as in the case of Hathor, cited above.
Thus when Hathor appears with a cow&rsquo;s
head upon a human body, she appears with
the solar disk between her horns; and when
she appears with the human head, she wears
as a headdress the bonnet of the goddess Mut,
the wife of Amon-Ra, the horns of the cow,
the solar disk which shows her relationship
to Horus, and the feather of the goddess
Maat.</p>
<p>We have previously asserted that each
plague was a direct blow at one of these
celestial beings, and it might be profitable
to demonstrate this fact with a few concrete
illustrations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<div class="img" id="imgx4">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="334" height="599" />
<p class="pcap">Hapi</p>
</div>
<p>The First Plague was a direct
and definite blow at a
numerous company of these
objects of worship. In the
first place, the River Nile was
itself an object of worship.
It was reputed to flow from
the celestial stream called Nu,
and was heavenly in its origin.
It brought life to the entire
land of Egypt, and was worshipped
with appropriate and very exact ritual.
There were hymns to the Nile, prayers
and offerings to and for the Nile, and the
river possessed in itself a very real personality.
The River is pictured in the form of
a man wearing a cluster of water plants upon
his head, and the idea of fertility is conveyed
by giving him the heavy pendant breasts of
a nursing mother! In the British Museum
may be seen a remarkable papyrus, containing
the Hymn to the Nile. To show the
reverence felt for the power of the great
River, we quote just a sentence or two from
this Hymn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... Thou art the Lord of the poor and needy.
If thou wert overthrown in the heavens, the
gods would fall upon their faces, and men
would perish....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This deified river, then, the source of life
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
and blessing in Egypt, was smitten by God,
and its waters turned to blood. Frantically
the Egyptians sought to dig shallow wells
by the banks of the stream, as their water
supply failed them for the first time in the
memory of man! Truly, Jehovah was greater
than the Nile! And not only greater than
the River itself, there was more than this
involved. There were many issues involved,
and many deities suffered &ldquo;loss of face&rdquo; that
day!</p>
<div class="img" id="imgx5">
<img src="images/p10a.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="601" />
<p class="pcap">Osiris</p>
</div>
<p>There was the mighty Osiris,
who was himself the cause and
source of the resurrection and of
everlasting life. Greatest of all
the gods of the underworld, he has
an important part in the text of
the Book of the Dead. The Nile
was supposed to be his bloodstream!
When God smote the Nile,
he laid the mighty Osiris low in
the dust! With him fell Hapi&mdash;who was the
Nile-god, and also Satet, the wife of Khnemu,
the goddess of the annual inundation. Her
divine sister, Anqet, bit the dust that day,
as she was the personification of the Nile waters,
which turned into an offense and a
stench when Moses stretched out his staff.
Time will not permit the presentation of the
characters of Isis-Sothis, Isis-Hathor, Ament,
Menat, Renpit and at least two score more,
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
all of whom met defeat in the First Plague.
None of them could sustain their prestige
and power in the face of the action of Jehovah,
and He emerged victorious in the
first trial of strength.</p>
<div class="img" id="imgx6">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="690" />
<p class="pcap">Khnum</p>
</div>
<p>The Second Plague was likewise
a contest between the Lord
of the heavens and the earth,
and certain specific ideas of the
Egyptian system of worship.
The plague of frogs that covered
the land, making life a
burden to the people, was a
blow struck at Heqt, the wife of
the great Khnum, whose theophany
was a frog. Indeed, she was called
the &ldquo;frog-goddess,&rdquo; and this lowly creature
was sacred to her. The frog was the symbol
of the resurrection, and the emblem of fertility.
It was reverenced by the people, and
to have one around the dwelling place was
a sign of good fortune and was supposed to
ensure a fertile year for farm and family
alike.</p>
<p>They got enough of this quaint object of
reverence when God flooded their land with
myriads of the beastly things! They were
in the bread-trough, and got tangled up in
the dough, thus adding a rather quaint flavor
to the bread! The bread could not be baked,
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
however, as the baking ovens crawled with
frogs, and the fires could not be lighted.
They hopped all over the master of the house,
and when he sought his bed in disgust they
were there before him.</p>
<p>Like a blanket of filth the slimy, wet monstrosities
covered the land, until men sickened
at the continued squashing crunch of
the ghastly pavement they were forced to
walk upon. If a man&rsquo;s feet slipped on the
greasy mass of their crushed bodies, he fell
into an indescribably offensive mass of putrid
uncleanness, and when he sought water to
cleanse himself, the water was so solid with
frogs, he got no cleansing there. In sheer
desperation the mighty king was forced to
beg, &ldquo;Call off your frogs, and I will let the
people go!&rdquo; Read Exodus 8:1-15.</p>
<p>And with that cry, the prestige of Heqt
and Khnum was gone forever, drowned out
in the tidal wave of disgust that rolled up
in protest at <i>too much</i> of her theophany!</p>
<p>It is a bit difficult to imagine that generation
of Egyptians ever worshipping the Frog
again.</p>
<p>Plagues Three and Four are a bit more
difficult to deal with at the present writing,
because of the personal ignorance of the
writer. By that he means to say that more
light is required here as he does not know
definitely the exact god that was meant to
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
suffer in the estimation of the people, with
the plague of lice. There can be no question,
however, that the people themselves were
hard hit, as any veteran of the A. E. F. will
be only too glad to testify! This unclean
parasite must have been a source of misery
that was well-nigh insuperable, when it became
as numerous as the very dust of the
ground! It must have made the Egyptians
somewhat envious to see the Israelites basking
in peace and bodily comfort, while they,
the lords of the land, itched and scratched
and suffered the misery of this vicious pest!
How much better to trust the God Jehovah
who demonstrated His ability to keep His
followers free from even such a plague as
this.</p>
<p>As for the flies, there is this suggestion,
at least: one of them was sacred to the name
of Uatchit. What variety of fly is intended
in the text we cannot definitely say, as there
are numerous species of flies. But the
<i>ichneumon</i> fly is a symbol of this god, and
their figures in tiny statues and on papyri
are well known to the modern archeologist.
They are a brilliant and beautiful insect,
somewhat prized by the entomologists of our
day as specimens, but they can be a pest
when they come in too numerous companies!</p>
<p>Some years ago we were encamped in
Mexico, with a company who were digging
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
for archeological treasure. The site was
pleasant, the camp was near a clear, meandering
stream, and the shade trees were enjoyable.
There was just &ldquo;one fly in the ointment&rdquo;
and that fly was the ichneumon. Every
time food was placed upon the camp table,
this gorgeous insect responded with enthusiasm
and delight. They came in regiments
and companies, bringing all their relatives
and friends with them! So we could say
from experience, that anyone who had to
fight with a swarm of ichneumon flies for
his own share of the lunch, would soon come
to revile the god to whom this symbol was
sacred! Not only Jehovah, but <i>any</i> god
would seem preferable to Uatchit after an
invasion of his particular pets. Or should
we turn this last word around and make it
pest, instead?</p>
<div class="img" id="imgx7">

<p class="pcap">Hathor</p>
</div>
<p>When we come to the Fifth
Plague, we are again on solid
and assured territory. Once
more firm archeological ground
supports the theme of this chapter.
When God smote the cattle
of Egypt, He dealt most definitely
and drastically with Egyptian
polytheism. There were
many of the supreme objects of
Egyptian worship that met their
Waterloo in the murrain on the cattle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Chief of these is the mighty and venerated
Hathor. She was the &ldquo;cow-goddess&rdquo; that
was universally worshipped in all the land,
and was to the human race of that day the
&ldquo;mother&rdquo; principle of deity. Her most common
name in the Egyptian language is Het-Hert,
which literally means &ldquo;the House of
Horus.&rdquo; The House of Horus is that portion
of the sky where Horus lives and is daily
born, namely, the east. Hathor is depicted
in antiquity in many forms. Always she appears
with a human body, and may sometimes
have a human head as well. But more often
she has a cow&rsquo;s head on a human body, as the
cow was her symbol. She often walked the
land in the theophany of a cow, and one
could tell when a calf was born, whether
Hathor had come to earth, or not.</p>
<p>When this great goddess is pictured with
a human head, she wears an impressive headdress.
This is composed of the spreading
horns of a cow, between which are seen the
bonnet of Mut, the divine wife of Amon-Ra,
the king of the gods. Above this is seen the
solar disk, as Hathor was of &ldquo;The Great Company&rdquo;
and was associated with all the beneficence
of the glorious and life-giving sun.
The Book of the Dead teaches that Hathor
provides nourishment for the soul in the
other-world, and as such a provider she excels
all the minor gods. So in all the forms
in which she is carved or drawn, she wears
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
the sacred uraeus, to show her exalted power.</p>
<p>When God smote the cattle, her especial
symbol, He struck a mighty blow at the
tottering system for which Pharaoh had confidently
expressed his preference. The other
forays were but skirmishes: this was a real
and decisive battle! This shrewd and telling
victory was the beginning of the end of
the conflict. If the divine Hathor could not
protect her faithful following from the power
of Jehovah, who could?</p>
<p>For not only Hathor was thus challenged
and defeated, but other important members
of the Heavenly Company met defeat and
disgrace in the plague that smote the cattle.
A common object in the Egypt of that day
was the sacred bull, Apis, whose power was
vast indeed. His temples dotted the land,
and the priests of his cult were many and
their power was impressive in the extreme.
On the forehead of Apis appears the sacred
triangle of eternity, and on his back is always
seen the sacred scarab, with spread
wings.</p>
<p>Apis was the theophany of the god whose
name was Ptah-Seker-Asar, and he also was
one of the triune resurrection gods. The
living worshipped him that they might live
again in the world to come, and the dead,
of course, all worshipped him because he
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
had made them to live again. Now, alas,
for those who trusted in him against Jehovah!
He could not even defend his own
earth-form from the blight that his new
enemy, Jehovah, had sent on all that represented
the great and powerful Ptah-Seker-Asar.
Thus God humbled the sacred Apis
in the same stroke that crushed the cult of
Hathor.</p>
<p>To this record must also be added the name
of Nut, the goddess of the sky, and the wife
of Geb. She it was who produced the egg
out of which the sun hatched, so in reality
she preceded Horus and even Amon-Ra, even
though they ascended to a higher power and
authority later. She is depicted with a female
human body, and the head of a cow.
However, she does not wear the solar disk,
nor the headdress of Hathor, as she was a
little lower in the social company of the weird
organization of nonsense and mysticism that
was the religion of Egypt.</p>
<p>The simple summary of the whole record
is just this: all the gods of Egypt were not
able to defend the cattle, when the Lord God
Jehovah stretched out His hand to smite
them! This the people of Egypt were forced
to concede, as their cattle died by the thousand
before their bewildered eyes, while not
one of the herds of Israel lost so much as
one head of cattle by the murrain.</p>

<p class="pcap">Reshpu</p>
</div>
<p>The Sixth and Seventh
Plagues are simple to deal
with, as the record of Egypt
gives valuable aid to the unprejudiced
student here. Imhotep
was the god of medicine,
and the guardian of
all the healing sciences.
Prayers were made to him
for protection as well as for
cures, and he was greatly revered. In like
manner, Reshpu and Qetesh were the gods
of storm and of battle, and they controlled
all the natural elements except the light. So
the noisome and painful boils struck the devotees
of Imhotep and left him powerless to
aid his praying following, and their plight
was pitiful indeed. How little it helped to
see that the followers of the god Jehovah,
at whom Pharaoh had sneered with ridicule,
were comfortable, and with unblemished
skins! No suppurating sores advertised the
pain of the Hebrews; the good hand of their
God was upon them, to protect them from
the very disaster that came upon all the
Egyptians for Israel&rsquo;s sake!</p>
<p>The medical man of the twentieth century,
whose article we are now considering, attributes
all this painful consequence to the
bacteriological pollution of the Nile, which
was accomplished by the skill and wisdom
of Moses. The present writer of this refutation
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
is not utterly ignorant of the science of
bacteriology, but he humbly confesses that
he does not know of any pathogenic micro-organism
that would bite everybody except
a Hebrew! We would like to know the name
and the nature of such a bacterium or bacillus!
The Hebrews were exposed to the same
flies, the same germs, the same stench of the
dead frogs, the same epidemic that was consequent
upon this chain of events, unless
Moses vaccinated or inoculated them all,
some three and a half millions in number.
Truly the natural explanations of the supernatural
cause reason to totter on her throne!</p>

<p>But if God was at war with
Imhotep, Reshpu and the gods
of healing, and desired to scatter
their following and to open
their eyes to the folly of idol
worship, we can see how He
might protect His own, while
smiting the followers of the
false religion. In that case
also, Moses would not need to
be the only man in antiquity who could call
up a devastating hail storm at the dictate of
his own will. Moses could leave it to God
to shame Reshpu and the other gods of the
elements in the eyes of their devotees.</p>
<p>The Eighth Plague, that of the locusts, is
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
the easiest of all to comprehend. This was
a direct blow at the Egyptian conception
of Providence, and a sweeping victory over
all that was holy in the eyes of this idolatrous
people. These ancient people ascribed the
fertility of their fields and the abundance
of the harvests to certain specific deities. The
modern scholar establishes this fact by studying
the hymns of praise and the votive records
of the Egyptians. But after the hail
had hammered their lovely ripening crops
flat on the ground, and even while they
mourned their loss, swarms of locusts descended
like a cloud, and swept the land as
clean of vegetation as a forest fire could have
done.</p>
<p>To see God&rsquo;s purpose in this act, we need
only consider the prophecy of Joel. With
a fidelity to detail that arouses the admiration
of the modern entomologist, this prophet
of Israel portrays the devastation of the land
by a swarm of locusts, as a judgment from
God upon His own people. When famine and
want stare men in the face, and they are beyond
the hope of other aid, then they turn
back to God in sorrow and in repentance.
For where can men turn except to God, when
the land lies barren and devastated, and
famine stalks the earth?</p>
<p>Thus in Egypt, when God would teach an
unforgettable lesson to the proud and haughty
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
king whose impertinent comment had been,
&ldquo;Who is this Jehovah?&rdquo;, He punctuated His
answer to Pharaoh&rsquo;s question with a swarm
of locusts. It is reasonable to conclude that
long after the starving Egyptians had forgotten
the pangs of hunger that came inevitably
on the heels of that visitation of
consuming insects, the lesson of that visitation
remained.</p>
<p>All these disasters, following one after the
other, had struck telling blows at the very
foundation of Egypt&rsquo;s religion. But a worse
was to follow.</p>
<p>The Ninth Plague struck at the very apex
and head of all the Great Company of the
pantheon. The most essential thing in all
the physical realm is light, and the Egyptians
seemed to realize this fact. The darkness
of the ninth plague was a supernatural darkness.
This much is evident from the record,
which says that it covered the land so grossly,
the people sought refuge in bed! Evidently
artificial light would not penetrate that fearful
gloom; <i>but the children of Israel had light
in their dwellings!</i></p>
<p>Of course they had it!</p>
<p>They are the people who later sang: &ldquo;Jehovah
is my light and my salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the songs of the Egyptians were directed
to different gods entirely. Here, then,
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
was a golden opportunity to test the might
of these conflicting ideas of deity. Is Jehovah
able to maintain His superiority over
the hosts of the Egyptian gods? They were
indeed mighty in the hearts of the people,
and the contest was long and grim.</p>
<p>First of all to consider, there was the incomparable
Thoth who had worked out the
system of placing all the stars, the sun and
the moon in the heavens. He had arranged
also the seasons, as they had been decreed
by Ra. Although inferior to Ra and to Horus,
nevertheless Thoth gave light by night, and
on those days that the sun was not visible.
He also gave Isis the power needed to raise
the dead, and to offend him was to suffer
eternal loss. Remembering that the Hebrews
had lived under this culture and psychology
for generations, and considering that they
all must have been tinctured somewhat with
these beliefs, many of them must have trembled
indeed when Jehovah calmly engaged in
battle with Thoth! So the Lord God not only
smote the god of Egypt in this part of the
conflict, but He also established His personal
superiority in the minds of His own
despairing people. Certainly, when this
plague ended, the Hebrews hastened to follow
His next commands without hesitancy,
even though those commands laid them in
danger of the death penalty under Egyptian
law.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<div class="img" id="imgx10">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="279" height="624" />
<p class="pcap">Sekhmet</p>
</div>
<p>A lesser deity, but also a powerful
one who suffered grievously
in loss of prestige while the
darkness reigned, was the fire-goddess
Sekhmet. She was the
divinity of fire, and thus also of
artificial light. This darkness
that covered the land during this
plague was called &ldquo;thick&rdquo; darkness,
and it was so impenetrable
that for three days and nights, the Egyptians
stayed in bed! They saw the face of no man
in those dark days and dense nights, and it
is evident that artificial light was useless.
Only in the houses of Israel did any light
shine, but in each dwelling in Goshen the
light was undimmed. So it was demonstrated
in the case of Sekhmet, the lioness-headed
goddess of artificial light, that she
was powerless when Jehovah invaded her
realm.</p>
<p>With what delight did Moses remember all
this, when later he wrote the words of the
First Chapter of Genesis. How his heart
must have thrilled as he spoke of God commanding
the light to shine on the first day
of creation, and recorded the obedience of
the light to the spoken word of Israel&rsquo;s God.
He had seen that when God commanded
darkness all the gods of Egypt were powerless
before Jehovah, and that it was therefore
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
simple for God to reverse the process, and
bring light to alleviate the darkness of the
chaos.</p>
<p>The section of the pantheon that crumbled
in the regard of the devoted Egyptians that
hour was a broad and numerous company.
No divinity of all the polytheistic company
was very much more reverenced than Horus,
the hawk-headed. He was called &ldquo;the eye of
Ra,&rdquo; and was the god of the noontime sun.
When the flaming heat of Ra was just overhead
at the hour of midday, and when its light
and heat were the most intense, Horus was
in the ascendancy. When the deep darkness
of the ninth plague hit the land, the hearts
of the people were sick with fright. Believing
that the sun was born anew every
morning, and having an intense and well-thought-out
system of deities connected with
this rite, they must have thought that there
had been wholesale slaughter and failure
among the heavenly beings. But there still
would smoulder in their deepest thinking,
the dim hope that at noon the incomparable
Horus would glow, as Ra was the omnipotent,
and his <i>eye</i> could not be dimmed. But not
only did the noon pass in the same awful
darkness, but two more noons followed each
other in slow succession, and the feebleness
of the once-revered Horus could no longer
be doubted. So when they said, &ldquo;Who is
mightier than Horus?&rdquo; the children of Israel
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
could reply with grateful hearts, &ldquo;Jehovah
is; see, we have light in <i>our</i> dwellings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But like many other heathen and idolatrous
people, the chief object of Egyptian worship
was the sun itself. The natural mind can
comprehend this, and there is a little of the
Parsee in most modern men. So to the
ancients the sun was a personification of
beneficence and providence. The worship
of the sun took many forms in Egypt, but
the oldest and most general form of that worship
was in the person of the god Ra, who
appears in ancient records in many guises,
and under many names. Perhaps the most
common of these names is Amon-Ra. He
was unquestionably the chief form of deity
to the Egypt of Moses&rsquo; generation.</p>
<div class="img" id="imgx11">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="660" />
<p class="pcap">Taueret</p>
</div>
<p>As far as it can be said that the
Egyptians conceived of a god-principle,
this was expressed in
the person of Ra. He was the
creator of earth and of heaven,
and of all things therein. All
other gods were parts of his person,
and members of his body
and substance. The pantheon
was headed by Ra, and after him
came the gods and goddesses
who were parts of his body. One was his
eye, another his ear, while still another was
his foot. This quaint conception was carried
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
out for every known section of the anatomy,
which the Egyptians seemed to have known
fairly well.</p>
<p>Seeing, then, that Ra was immanent, pervasive,
and the principle back of all deities,
he was the chief object of Jehovah&rsquo;s enmity,
and the real subject of the contest and conflict.
In all the other plagues the <i>parts</i> of
Ra were defeated, and now at last the two
ideas are locked in the final struggle. It was
preposterous to the Egyptians that any god
or power could be superior to Ra, as the sun
is the source and seat of all power. But
the plague of darkness left him shorn of
power and greatness, and prostrated him before
the feet of <i>Jehovah</i> forever. Three theophanies
had Ra, and God desecrated every
one of them!</p>
<p>Ra appeared in the form of the sun: so
that was blotted out of the sky for three days.
Sometimes he walked the earth in the form
of the first-born of a cow, if that first-born
was a bull. So the first-born of all the cattle
died, and Ra was covered with shame. Occasionally
he was supposed to visit men in
the form of a ram. The first-born were all
sacred to him and dedicated to him from
birth: yet when all the first-born of Egypt
died, the babes of Israel, with their cattle
and flocks were all safe, because they were
under the shed blood of what was Ra&rsquo;s chief
theophany, next to the sun! The application
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
of the blood to the lintel and the doorpost
was an act of blasphemy against Ra, yet in
that very defiance the Hebrews were acknowledging
at last that <i>Jehovah</i> should be
their God forever, in that He had proved His
power.</p>
<div class="img" id="imgx12">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="308" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Amon-Ra</p>
</div>
<p>The Tenth Plague intrudes
into the sphere of the ninth.
The death of the first-born was
the proverbial straw that broke
the camel&rsquo;s back, as far as the
Egyptian resistance to Jehovah
was concerned. This is still
aimed primarily at Ra, although
there were notable deities other
than he that suffered defeat in
this last and awful skirmish.
When the Children of Israel left Egypt,
bribed to depart by a people who were
prostrated with grief, the mourning Egyptians
pressed upon them the cattle and the
flocks, the gold and the jewels requested.
Anything to get rid of the devotees of the
awful Being who left every home in Egypt
bowed in sorrow, and who had slain, as well,
every particle of faith the people had in the
once-powerful gods of the land of captivity!</p>
<p>To name many of these gods would be to
weary the reader. But we cannot refrain
from naming Meskhemit, who was the goddess
of birth. She was also the companion
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
of Hathor, and overshadowed the first-born
of the land. To what avail, when <i>all</i> died
who were under her divine protection! And
even stronger than she, was the mighty Min,
the god of virility and generation. Closely
related to Amon-Ra, being the means of extending
the power of Ra to those who worshipped
him, he too, fell with a resounding
crash, when the hand of The-Only-God-That-There-Is
swept all the idols of Egypt off
their pedestals, in what might be called the
greatest &ldquo;ten rounds&rdquo; ever fought! Not only
did <i>Jehovah</i> win the battle and the crown,
He also won every round! The victory was
complete and crushing.</p>
<div class="img" id="imgx13">
<img src="images/p17a.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Set</p>
</div>
<p>Many centuries later, Paul
the Apostle recalled all that is
implied and stated here, when
he wrote the ninth chapter of
Romans and the seventeenth
verse. Here it is stated that
God dealt so with Pharaoh, that
the name of God should be advertised
throughout all the
earth.</p>
<p>Is it so advertised?</p>
<p>Witness this article, cited above! Thirty-five
hundred years have come and gone since
these things transpired, but the mind of man
has not been able to escape from the demonstration
of God&rsquo;s power that He gave in
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
that far-off day. And all we can say about
this latest attempt to explain the victory of
God in the land of Egypt by attributing it
all to the smartness and genius of a learned
man, is, it just will not stand up! For the
God who smashed the pantheon of Egypt
evidently knew that this attempt was due,
and He raised from the dead, in an archeological
resurrection, the witnesses to the
facts at issue. And we have done nothing
in this simple reply but review <i>their</i> evidence!
But in so doing, we note again that modern
science, whenever her voice may be heard,
establishes the Scripture and vindicates its
claim, that &ldquo;holy men of old spake as they
were moved by the spirit of God.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />Sources</h2>
<p>One of the many questions that are frequently
asked of the archeologist, and one
that is most difficult to answer in a few brief
words, concerns the source of his material.
There is a sort of mystery that hovers over
this modern calling which intrigues the fancy
of the average layman. When an archeologist
begins to dig in some barren waste of
sand and comes upon a buried city that has
been missing from the history of men for
multiplied centuries, it impresses the casual
observer as magic of the blackest kind.
There is, however, nothing supernatural or
uncommon about these discoveries, although
the element of chance does enter in to a minor
extent. Some of the greatest and most prolific
fields we personally have investigated
were brought to our attention when the plow
of a farmer cast up a human skull and focussed
attention upon that particular field.
Generally, however, the sources of archeology
are uncovered by hard, patient, painstaking
labor.</p>
<p>When an able prospector starts out in his
search for gold, he is guided by certain known
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
factors that have been derived from the experience
of generations. Panning his way
up a stream-bed, the keen-eyed hunter of
fortune tests every spot that previous experience
had taught him might be profitable.
He may labor at one thousand barren sites
before he strikes gold. If he is in a mountainous
country and the placer deposits are
not rich enough to pay him to tarry on the
spot where the first discovery was made, he
will work his way on up the stream, testing
site after site for increasing values. If the
show of color in his pan suddenly ceases, he
knows that he has passed the sources of
these wandering fragments. He then goes
back to the last point where he found traces
of gold and then begins to search the side
canyons and branch streams that lead into
the main channel. In this way he traces his
path step by step to the ledge from which
the gold originally came. After laboring
weary months, or even years, with heart-breaking
disappointment and grim, hard
work, if he is fortunate he announces a discovery.
The thoughtless immediately credit
his good fortune to the goddess of luck and
wonder why they also could not be blessed
that way.</p>
<p>This illustration is an exact picture of the
manner in which archeologists go about their
business. There are certain sites that experience
has taught us should be profitable
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
to investigate. The region is carefully combed
for surface indications. These may be such
things as shards of pottery, arrowheads,
fragmentary bones, or any of the ordinary
debris that indicates a site of human habitation
or burial. When the surface indications
suggest the probability of a real find, then
the digging commences. Most of our great
discoveries are made only after months, and
even years, of painstaking survey. These
surveys must be made by men who are expert
in the interpretation of surface indications
and fragmentary evidences. Thus it is
at once apparent that there is really nothing
supernatural or magical about this sober
craft; it is scientific in its procedure. There
is no &ldquo;doodle-bug&rdquo; for archeology such as
is sometimes used by those who are found
around the fringe of geology.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that the orientals
differed greatly in their building methods
from the occidentals. It is customary among
us to excavate to bed rock before we lay the
foundation for a building. The orientals,
however, began to build right on the surface
of any site that suited their fancy. For instance,
a wandering tribe of nomads desiring
to settle either temporarily or permanently,
would pick out a hill that was more easily
defended than a level site would be. Upon
its crest, they built their houses and generally
fenced the scene for the purposes of
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
defense. Within these fortifying walls they
dwelt in more or less security until they became
rich enough to be robbed. It would not
be long, however, under the brutal law of
might that prevailed in those ancient days, before
some marauding band would overrun
that site with fire and sword. The walls would
be breached or cast down and the inhabitants
put to sword or carried away into slavery.
Usually fire would sweep the homes of this
once contented people and their memory
would soon be forgotten.</p>
<p>To one who has seen the sand storms of
the East, the rest of the story is self-evident.
Even in our own times and in our own land,
we have seen what can happen when drought
and wind begin to move the surface of a
country and make the efforts of man fruitless
and unavailing. When men lived in
these sites of antiquity and kept the encroaching
sands swept and shoveled out, they were
able to maintain their position of security.
As soon, however, as the site was deserted,
the sand would begin to drift over the deserted
ruins. In a very few years the remains
of the ruined city would be lost from
the sight of men. Perhaps a century or two
would pass by, during which this abandoned
region would be devoid of habitation.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Then another company of people looking
for a permanent dwelling place would chance
upon this hill. Finding it suited to their requirements
they would immediately start
building upon the surface. With no knowledge
whatever that a previous group of people
had made this hill their habitation, the
new dwellings and walls would rise high
upon the covered ruins of the earlier period.
Within a comparatively short time they also
would be the victims of some wandering conqueror,
and once again the wrecked habitations
of men would be repossessed by the
drifting sands of the desert. It is not uncommon
that in the course of a thousand
years such an experience would be repeated
from three or four to a dozen times upon
the same site.</p>
<p>When the archeologist finds such a mound
or hill, he has a treasure indeed. By excavating
this deposit one stratum at a time, he
builds up a stratographical record which is
highly important in reconstructing a consecutive
history of this region. The date factors
of the various strata are generally established
by the contents of each horizon of dwelling,
in turn. If the archeologist depends upon
facts instead of his imagination, a credible
chronology for the entire region can thus be
constructed.</p>
<p>In such a recovery the common life of the
people of antiquity is revealed in amazing
detail. We learn their customs of living,
something of their arts and crafts and their
manner of labor. Their knowledge of architecture
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
is clearly portrayed through such
ruins as remain, and the general picture of
the incidental events that made up their living
is clearly developed as the work proceeds.</p>
<p>Since the destruction of such a city was
usually catastrophic, the record suddenly
breaks off at the point of the tragedy. The
abruptness wherewith the life and activity
ceased, leaves all of the valuable material
undisturbed <i>in situ</i>. This circumstance,
though unfortunate for the ancients, is a
happy one for the archeologist who thus is
enabled to rebuild their times and lives.</p>
<p>These sites yield many types of material.
In establishing chronology, the most important
of all of these is probably the pottery.
There is no age of men so ancient that it
does not yield proof of human ability in the
ceramic art. Without aluminum cooking
utensils or iron skillets, the folk of antiquity
depended upon clay for the vessels of their
habitation. Dishes, pots, jars, and utensils of
a thousand usages were all made of this common
substance. Before the invention of paper,
clay was also the common material for
preserving written records. As each race
of people had its own peculiarities in the use
of clay, the pottery that is found on a given
site is one of the finest indications of a date
factor that the site can contain.</p>
<p>Even after the invention of papyrus or
parchment, these types of writing material
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
were too costly for the average person to use.
Requiring some cheap, common, readily accessible
material upon which to write, the
poor of antiquity laid hold upon the one
source of supply that was never wanting.
This consisted of shards of pottery. By the
side of every dwelling in ancient times might
be found a small heap of broken utensils of
clay. The ingenuity of man suggested a
method of writing on these fragments. In
every home there was a pen made of a reed
and a pot of homemade ink. With these
crude tools, the common people corresponded
and made notes on pieces of clay vessels.
When a fragment of pottery was thus inscribed,
it was called an ostracon.</p>
<p>These ostraca are among the most priceless
discoveries of antiquity. They were
written in the vernacular and dealt with
the common daily affairs that made up the
lives of the humble. They shed a flood of
light upon the customs and beliefs of the
mass of the people. Some of the wall inscriptions
of great conquerors, if taken by themselves,
would give an impression of grandeur
and splendor to their entire era, if we believed
such record implicitly. But for every
king or conqueror there were multiplied
thousands of poor. These were the folks who
made up the mass of humanity and whose
customs and lives paint the true picture of
ancient times. Therefore, these ostraca, being
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
derived from the common people, are
the greatest aid in the reconstruction of the
life and times wherewith the Bible deals.</p>
<p>Another source of evidence is found in tools
and artifacts which show the culture of any
given time and region. Knowing how the
people worked and what they wrought, has
been of priceless value to the Biblical archeologist.
Since the critics made so great a
case out of the alleged culture of the people
in every age, it is eminently fitting that the
refutation of their error should come from
the people themselves.</p>
<p>Still another source of archeological material
is to be found in the art of antiquity.
It seems that from the time of Adam to the
present hour the desire to express our feelings
and emotions in the permanent form of
illustration has been common to man. The
sites of antiquity testify to this fact in unmistakable
terms.</p>
<p>In the art of the days of long ago many
subjects were covered. Much of the painting
and sculpture had to do with the religion of
the time. Thus we can reconstruct the Pantheon
of Egypt very largely from the illustrations
that come to us from monuments
and papyri.</p>
<p>Another large section of ancient art dealt
with the history of the time in which the
artists lived and wrought. Since the work
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
of such artists was generally intended to flatter
and please the reigning monarch, most of
this illustrated history is military in nature.
Thus we are able to confirm much of the Old
Testament history through the recovery of
ancient art.</p>
<p>Other artists, in turn, dealt with the human
anatomy, the style of dress and the industries
of old. When we gather together all of this
illuminating material, it is safe to say that
ancient artists have brought to us a source
of material which is not the least of the
treasures of antiquity.</p>
<p>A final source of material is found upon
the walls that made up the actual dwellings
of old. This business of scribbling names
and dates upon public buildings or objects of
interest is not unique to modern men. Deplorable
as the custom may be, this ancient
vulgarity has, nevertheless, proved a great
boon to the archeologist of our day. For instance,
many of the scribes and officials of
antiquity, traveling about the country upon
the business of their lords, would visit one
of the tombs of a former age. Prompted by
curiosity and interest in the grandeur of antiquity,
they came to stare and to learn.
Their emotions being aroused they desired
some expression. This desire they sometimes
satisfied by inscribing upon the wall
of a certain tomb or temple their names and
the fact that at such a date they visited and
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
saw this wonder. Since they generally dated
their visit by the reign of the king under
whom they lived and served, a chronology
may be builded for antiquity from this source
of material alone.</p>
<p>It has been more or less customary in our
era for the itinerant gentry to leave valuable
information for fellows of their fraternity
who come along after them. This custom also
is a survival of an ancient day. A man
journeying from one region to another would
stop by the side of a blank wall and inscribe
road directions for any who might follow
after him. Sometimes he would add his name
and the year of the reign of a given monarch.
It was not unusual also for such an amateur
historian to make some caustic and pertinent
comments upon the country, the officials, or
the people. These spontaneous records are
priceless. They are the free expression of
an honest opinion and are not constructed
with the idea of deluding posterity with a
false standard of the grandeur of some conquering
king.</p>
<p>It is rather amusing now to look back to
the long battle that was fought between
criticism and orthodoxy in this very field.
With a dogmatic certainty which was characteristic
of the assumptions of the school
of higher criticism, these mistaken authorities
assured us that the age of Moses was an
age of illiteracy. In fact, the extreme scholars
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
of this school asserted that writing was
not invented until five hundred years after
the age of Moses. We have ourselves debated
that question with living men.</p>
<p>One such occasion occurred recently, when
we were delivering a series of lectures at
Grand Rapids, Michigan. The subject had
to deal with archeology and the Bible, and
the men in attendance seemed to appreciate
the opening lecture extremely. Therefore,
we were the more surprised when a gentleman,
clad in clerical garb, came forward and
in the most abrupt and disagreeable manner
demanded,</p>
<p>&ldquo;By what authority do you state that Moses
wrote the Pentateuch? Your dogmatic assertion
is utterly baseless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In some surprise we replied, &ldquo;I am sorry
to sound dogmatic, as I try never to dogmatize.
All that I mean to imply is that I am
absolutely certain that he <i>did</i> write it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our humor, which was intended as oil on
troubled waters, turned out to be more like
gasoline on raging fires! The exasperated
gentleman exclaimed with considerable more
heat than he had previously manifested, &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t <i>prove</i> that Moses wrote the Pentateuch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;as the boot
is on the other foot! May I quote to you a
section from Greenleaf on Evidence? Here
is the citation: &lsquo;When documents purporting
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
to come from antiquity, and bearing upon
their face no evident marks of forgery, are
found in the proper repository, the law presumes
such documents to be authentic and
genuine, and <i>the burden of proof to the contrary
devolves upon the objector</i>.&rsquo; Now, my
dear brother, these documents <i>do</i> come from
antiquity. They bear no evidence of forgery,
and have thus been accepted and accredited
in all of the ages that make up three millenniums
of time. You face a problem if you
are going to repudiate all the evidence and
tradition of their credibility. Just how are
you going to prove that Moses <i>did not</i> write
these books ascribed to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easy,&rdquo; the scholarly brother retorted.
&ldquo;Moses could not have written the
first five books of the Bible, because writing
was not invented until five hundred years
after Moses died!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In great amazement I asked him, &ldquo;Is it possible
that you never heard of the Tel el Armana
tablets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He never had!</p>
<p>So we took time to tell him of the amazing
discovery of this great deposit of written
records from the library of Amenhetep the
Third, and their bearing upon the great controversy.
Then we told him also of the older
records of Ur, that go all the way back to
the days of the queen Shub Ab, and manifest
a vast acquaintance with the art of writing
as far back of Abraham as this patriarch in
turn preceded the Lord Jesus Christ! He
frankly confessed his total ignorance of this
entire body of accumulated knowledge, and
then closed the debate by stating,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it may be that every one else in antiquity
could write, <i>but Moses couldn&rsquo;t...!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And such an one would accuse another of
dogmatism! Because we stand upon the certainty
of the approved and orthodox conception
of the credibility of the Scriptures, and
maintain our case with the most exact evidence,
we are not &ldquo;scholarly.&rdquo; Yet here is
a reputedly religious leader, utterly ignorant
of an enormous body of knowledge derived
from a generation of research, who misleads
those who are unfortunate enough to be under
his ministry, and offers them the fallacious,
repudiated, and utterly baseless conclusions
of higher criticism, in the place of
the living bread which God has provided for
His children! This is but to be expected
when we think the matter through. The
bread of life is to be found only in the pages
of God&rsquo;s Book. Therefore, if the source of
this bread is rejected and derided, the bread
cannot be available!</p>
<p>The great pity of the matter is seen in the
fact that this attitude is entirely untenable,
in the light of our present knowledge. Although
our science has demonstrated a remarkable
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
culture for the very age of the
patriarchs, we are faced with religious leaders
who are so far behind the advanced learning
of our day that they still teach the outmoded
nonsense of criticism, and claim that
Moses could not write!</p>
<p>It is rather amusing in the light of this dogmatic
assurance of critical authorities to
journey back through the hallways of time
and find that writing was a common custom
a thousand years before Moses, or even a
thousand years before that! Throughout
Egypt especially, the art of writing was a
universal possession among all classes of the
populace. The toilet articles used by the
beauties of Ancient Egypt were highly engraved
with charms, and with prayers to the
goddess of beauty. As an Egyptian damsel
prepared herself for the evening&rsquo;s engagement,
she would read these prayers and
charms which were supposed to give her
divine aid in impressing the ladies with her
outstanding beauty! Poems of love and lyrics
of passion were engraved upon her toilet articles
and were incised upon the walls of her
apartment as well.</p>
<p>In addition to this, most of the ancients
wore amulets to guard them against the evil
eye and every sort of disaster.</p>
<p>Some wore engraved pectorals that showed
the high development of the art of writing
to a great antiquity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Businessmen of various kinds, minor officials
and even the common people carried
upon their persons seals wherewith to sign
the documents and contracts of their casual
business affairs.</p>
<p>From this common source there is a kaleidoscopic
view of ancient life that thrills the
observer with its ever-changing magnitude.
It is almost impossible to limit the value of
such discoveries as to the integrity of the
Scriptures. In all this enormous mass of
authoritative data not one single fact has ever
been derived which argued against the credibility
of any statement in the Bible.</p>
<p>An even more important source of historical
evidence is found among the papyri of
old. This valuable material was invented in
Egypt at a very early age. In Upper Egypt
the Nile was bordered, and in some places
overgrown, with a prolific reed which is scientifically
called &ldquo;cyperus papyrus.&rdquo; It is
from this name that the paper manufactured
from this substance derives its identification.
The manufacture of papyrus was a simple
procedure which nevertheless required time.
Briefly stated, strips of the papyrus reed, cut
to a uniform length and saturated with water,
were laid down side by side. Another layer
of strips was laid across them transversely,
and usually a third layer was superimposed
upon the second layer. These layers of reed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
being laid in alternate directions, were then
pounded with a flat paddle and smashed into
a pulp. When the mass dried, it was a sheet
of rough paper, somewhat comparable to the
paper towels that are used in our generation.
The edges were trimmed smoothly and the
surface of the paper was smoothed off with
a shell or rubbed with sand. This finished
side of the paper was called the obverse and
was the side upon which writing was customarily
inscribed. So expensive was this
substance, however, that frequently both
sides would be covered with writing. In that
case the rough side was always known as
the reverse. Many of these papyri not only
were inscribed with a written text but were
highly illustrated with scenes depicting the
life and customs of the people. These illumined
papyri, some of which go back to
a very remote age, are of tremendous value
to the student of the Scriptures.</p>
<p>We have, for instance, papyri from Egypt
at the time of Moses, showing the fowlers
engaged in capturing quail. (See <a href="#pl10">Plate 10</a>.)
These birds being tired by their long
flight in their annual African migration, fell
easy victims to the men who smote them to
the earth or captured them in hand nets. Incidentally,
the author has frequently been
offered such quail upon the streets of Cairo
by vendors who earned a precarious living
by peddling such game. Many Scriptural
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
events are attested in this manner by these
illustrated manuscripts.</p>
<p>Since there was a high content of starch in
the finished papyrus, it was possible to make
them any length desired. By moistening the
edges of two sheets and pressing or pounding
them together, the result would be a
single sheet when the joint had dried. This
process could be continued indefinitely. As
a method of comparison let us note that the
entire Gospel of John could be written on
a papyrus of the usual width, if it was eighteen
feet in length. Such a long sheet would
be rolled to form a complete volume. The
longest papyrus we have ever seen is in the
British Museum and is exhibit No. 9999. This
single sheet is 135 feet long.</p>
<p>Another papyrus of unusual length is that
which shows the funery experiences of the
scribe Ani. This is a highly illumined specimen
and contains many illustrations of the
soul of Ani, as he goes through the intricate
process of achieving eternal life in the realm
of Osiris. This papyrus is 78 feet long and
is one foot, three inches wide. The average
sheet of papyrus, however, is about six by
nine inches.</p>
<p>These papyrus records are divided into
many kinds and types. Some of them are
funery, and deal with the events of the decease
and resurrection of the individual. Most
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
noteworthy among the papyri of this type
are the various texts of the &ldquo;Book of the
Dead.&rdquo; These are illuminated with scenes
of religious beliefs. They depict the experience
of the soul on its pilgrimage into the
hereafter. They tell of the conditions of life
in the other world and the manner of entering
into a blessed state after death.</p>
<p>There are also papyri that deal with pure
literature. Almost every subject common to
modern literature is found in the ancient records
of this type. For instance, fiction was
a common field for the scribe of antiquity.
The British Museum contains many of these
prized papyri, as does the Egyptian Museum
at Cairo.</p>
<p>It might surprise the modern reader to
know that the Egyptian people of old highly
prized stories of mystery and imagination.
Some of their greater manuscripts bear a
strong resemblance to portions of the Arabian
Nights, and they may indeed have been the
original basis of that later production.</p>
<p>In the British Museum a papyrus, No.
10183, is a fine example of this common
theme. This is entitled, &ldquo;The Tale of the
Two Brothers.&rdquo; In the introductory section,
the life of a humble farmer in ancient Egypt
is given in detail. The familiar triangle develops
between the elder brother, his wife
and the younger brother. The plot develops
when the wicked wife made herself sick by
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
rancid grease, and, bruising herself with a
stick, lay moaning on the floor when her
husband returned. Accusing the younger
brother of attempted assault, she aroused her
husband&rsquo;s anger to the point where he
grabbed an edged weapon and set out to kill
the suspected villain. The oxen, however,
told the younger brother of the ambush that
was set for him and he fled the home. Marvelous
miracles occurred during this flight,
which opened the eyes of the elder brother
to the injustice that he had been about to
perpetrate. Whereupon he returned home,
and satisfied the demands of the stern justice
of his day by slaying his wife and feeding her
body to his pet dogs. The rest of the story
is taken up with the wanderings and adventures
of the younger brother. This record
goes back to the thirteenth century B. C.,
and is a perfect specimen of the fiction of
that time.</p>
<p>Limited space will not permit the introduction
of other notable classics of fiction
such as the story of the shipwrecked sailor;
the story of the doomed prince; the story
of the possessed princess; the story of the eloquent
peasant, and any number of other
records, nor is their presentation essential
to the development of our thesis. Their value,
however, is seen in the fact that not only
do they depict the literary tastes of antiquity,
but they delineate many of the common details
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
and incidents of the daily life of those
ages.</p>
<p>There are also any number of poems which
have a high historical value. We shall refer
later to the famed poem of Pentauer, which
immortalizes the victories of Ramses the
Second, which this great conqueror achieved
over Egypt&rsquo;s ancient enemies the Hittites.
The discovery of this record was the first appearance
of the Hittites in archeology and
caused a sensation in the ranks of Biblical
criticism.</p>
<p>Among the more sober types of literature
will be found narratives of pure history. Such
would be the lists of the kings, giving the
chronology of the dynasty of each. Records
of conquest, lists of tribute, and the names
of captive races form the bulk of this type
of material.</p>
<p>There are also books of maxims teaching
the higher morality of the age in which the
papyrus was written. In a word, the literature
preserved in the papyri of Egypt deals
with religious aims, books of magic, records
of travel, and the science of that day. From
the latter we learn their beliefs and technique
in the realm of astronomy. Their system of
mathematics is preserved for us in such prize
records as the Rhind Papyrus which deals
with the geometry of that age. This papyrus
is in the British Museum and is numbered
10,057. In the Museum at Cairo is a papyrus
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
illustrating the geography and cartography
of antiquity. This famous map shows the
religious divisions of that province, which is
now called the Fayyum. Others of these
papyri deal with medicine as it was practiced
in that ancient day. There are, of course,
biographical papyri that are almost innumerable,
all of which reconstruct for us the lives
and times of these people who are so long
dead, but far from forgotten.</p>
<p>Among the most important of all the varieties
of papyri are those which preserve
for us the embalming technique practiced at
various stages in the development of this art
in Egypt. Since the Egyptians believed that
the resurrection of the body and its eternal
life depended upon the preservation of the
physical form, they took great pains in their
preparations for the burial of their dead. The
most graphic description of the method used
is given by Herodotus and is thus familiar
to all students of history. This noted writer
states that three general methods were used
by the Egyptians and the cost of each was
graduated to the thoroughness of the method.</p>
<p>The most expensive means of embalming
was an elaborate process indeed. The abdominal
cavity was opened and the viscera
were removed from the body. These were
carefully washed in palm wine, thoroughly
dried and sprinkled with certain aromatic
spices. The brains were withdrawn from
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
the head and treated in this same fashion.
These cavities were then dried and filled
with a combination of bitumen, myrrh, cassia
and various other expensive and astringent
spices. The openings were then sewed up.
A tank was prepared which was filled with
a solution of soda, and the body was steeped
in it for seventy days. After removal from
this pickling solution the body was thoroughly
dried in the hot sun and anointed with
spicy compounds which had the two-fold purpose
of imparting a fragrant odor to the
mummy and of further preserving its structure.
The process was completed when the
body was wound with the strips of linen
with which all students of Egyptology are
so familiar.</p>
<p>The cost of this type of embalming varied,
of course, in each dynasty, but as a general
average it would be in the neighborhood of
$1500 in our modern currency. When we
consider the disparity between our standard
of money value and that of ancient Egypt,
it can be seen that such a preparation was
enormously expensive.</p>
<p>A cheaper method of embalming consisted
of dissolving the viscera by means of oil of
cedar. The flesh also was dissolved with
a caustic soda solution, and the skin shrunk
tightly to the bones. This dessicated form
was then wrapped in the traditional linen
bandages. The cost of this process was in
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
the neighborhood of $300 in the currency
of our day.</p>
<p>For the very poor, however, a cheaper form
of preparation was used. The body was
dumped into the tank of soda, where it was
alternately saturated and dried for a period
of seventy days. The pickled body was then
handed over to the relatives, who wrapped
it according to their own ability and means
and arranged for burial at any convenient
site. This process would cost in the neighborhood
of $1.50 in our present standard of
currency.</p>
<p>It will be noted that the customary period
of embalming was seventy days. A discrepancy
has been fancied here between this
ordinary custom and the embalming of Israel,
as it is recorded in the fiftieth chapter of
Genesis. The third verse of that chapter
states, &ldquo;And forty days were fulfilled for
him, for so are fulfilled the days of those
which are embalmed: and the Egyptians
mourned for him three score and ten days.&rdquo;
The discrepancy, however, has been cleared
up by the discovery of the fact that under
the Hyksos Dynasties the period of the embalming
was forty days instead of seventy,
and the mourning of the dead was more important
than the time used in preserving the
body.</p>
<p>In the Egyptian Museum at Cairo, exhibit
No. 1270, is a magnificent anthropoid sarcophagus
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
from the time of Psammetichus the
Second. The inscription on this sarcophagus
confirms the statement that the embalming
process lasted seventy days and is a testimony
of the honesty of the undertaker in
that he did not shorten the time for the extra
profit involved.</p>
<p>It is to the reverence for their dead that
was manifested by all in Egypt that we owe
our present wealth of archeological material.
The most voluminous evidences for the accuracy
of the Bible come to us from burial
sources. Very often the coverings of the
corpse were inscribed with verbose descriptions
of the life, morals, and piety of the
dead individual.</p>
<p>A further source of material is found on
the cartonnage. When the body had been
encased in bandages a type of coffin was
made that is called mummiform or, more
commonly, anthropoid. (See <a href="#fig1">Frontispiece</a>.)
This first covering was made of some plastic
material, which was moulded to the form of
the individual to be buried. In the earlier
days this cartonnage was made of strips of
linen cloth pasted together and covered with
a type of shellac. While still plastic, this
material was moulded to the contour of the
head and shoulders of the occupant until it
took on a rough resemblance to the individual.
This may have been the origin of the
death-mask custom which continues in some
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
regions even to the present time. In later
times this first covering was gilded, and, in
the case of the very rich, might be decorated
also with eyes of obsidian or lapis lazuli.</p>
<p>In later periods, the cartonnage was made
of outmoded papyri. These were dampened
and moulded into a mulch like the method
of using papier-mache in our generation. In
so doing, however, the writing was not demolished.
Some of the greatest discoveries
of antiquity have come to us when a cartonnage
made of papyrus has been carefully
separated into its original sheets and the
writing thereof recovered.</p>
<p>When the mummy was enclosed in its cartonnage,
a wooden coffin was then prepared,
which quite frequently was also anthropoid
in shape. (See <a href="#pl11">Plate 11</a>.) Not only did it
maintain the form of the human body, but
very often it had also a painted portrait of
the dead person to identify the deceased. This
wooden coffin was painted and inscribed on
the inside and the outside with a record and
history of the individual, to which were added
scenes and texts from the Book of the Dead.
(See <a href="#pl12">Plate 12</a>.) This second coffin was not
always made of wood, however. In the case
of Tut-ankh-amen, the coffin was of solid
gold, and constituted a tremendous treasure
in itself. This was possible only to a monarch
or a noble of enormous wealth.</p>
<p>The final covering was the sarcophagus,
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
a great rectangular box sometimes made of
wood, but often formed of stone. In this
box the anthropoid coffin was carefully
placed and the lid was tightly sealed. In
preparing the sarcophagus, every inch of the
inside would be engraved with a record of
the history of the individual as well as of
the times in which he lived. On the inside
of this box, the bottom, both ends, and the
two sides would be covered with writing as
closely as the characters could be engraved.
Not content with this, the industrious scribe
of antiquity also covered the outside of the
sarcophagus, both ends, both sides, and the
top with further writings. We have illustrated
this custom clearly in <a href="#pl13">Plate 13</a>.</p>
<p>To make the case complete, the noble, the
wealthy, and the great of antiquity were
buried in tombs, the walls of which were
illuminated with frescoes, murals, and texts
in written script that covered every square
inch of space on the ceiling, as well as on the
four walls. All of the visitors to the Valley of
the Kings in Upper Egypt have wondered
over these remarkable and complete records.
They are, however, more than just a curious
sight to satisfy the interest of the tourists.
They are one of the priceless sources of valuable
information concerning the coincidence
of ancient history with the text of the Scripture!
(See <a href="#pl14">Plate 14</a>.)</p>
<p>Still another source of material and information
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
is found in the innumerable stelae
which covered the ancient world. The word
&ldquo;stele&rdquo; is a Greek word meaning &ldquo;an upright
stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archeologically it applies to slabs of stone
which were erected over a burial site in the
fashion of a headstone in our modern custom.
Some were square, some rectangular,
and some were artistically rounded at the
top. In the case of a burial stele, the name
of the man so honored, together with a record
of his life and conduct, was carved in
high relief upon the stone. Thereon were
named the king and the dynasty under which
the dead man had lived, and sometimes the
important historical events of that reign.
Always such a stele contained the episodes
of history to which the given individual had
personally contributed. They are a large
source of historical information. These stelae
were sometimes erected in public places as
memorials of great events. (See <a href="#pl15">Plate 15</a>.)</p>
<p>When Ramses the Second won his great
campaign against the Hittites, he ended a
five hundred year period of warfare in which
the Egyptians had been consistently defeated.
To celebrate his victory, a voluminous account
of his valor and skill was carved upon
a large number of stelae and erected in prominent
centers throughout his kingdom. So
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
also Amenhetep the Third set up a stele to
record his conquest of the country of Abhat.
This beautifully preserved record may be
seen in the British Museum. It is exhibit
No. 657 in Bay 6.</p>
<p>In the Egyptian Museum at Cairo there
is a stele originally erected by Amenhetep the
Third. We shall refer to this one again because
his successor Menepthah appropriated
this stele, and because it contains his record
of the Israelites, who are thus acknowledged
by the monarchs of Egypt to have been a
people of importance in the annals of their
empire.</p>
<p>The most stupendous source of material is
found in monuments. The larger and most
important type of monument is of course the
buildings of antiquity. To the Egyptologist
the most entrancing and magnificent spectacle
on the face of the earth is the ruined
temple at Karnak. The general public is so
familiar with the magnitude and extent of
these stupendous ruins, it is not necessary
to make more than a brief reference to them
in this paragraph. Any standard encyclopedia,
such as the current Britannica, carries
a more or less lengthy article on this subject,
and the number of interested observers who
have studied these ruins is almost beyond
estimating.</p>
<p>The present city of Luxor, in Upper Egypt,
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
was once known as Thebes, and was the center
of government in times long past. Three
very important sources of study are found
in that vicinity. There is the great Valley
of the Kings, where so many of the dead great
of Egypt were buried. Then also there is
the great temple at Luxor, which is still in
the process of recovery. It is to be regretted
that excavations there have been halted for
some time, due to the fanaticism of the Moslems,
who refuse to permit a mosque to be
moved from the top of the remaining mound,
under which the balance of this great temple
still lies buried.</p>
<p>Last, but far from least, there is the great
temple, called Karnak. The evidences that
have been recovered from this site carry us
as far back as the early stages of the Old
Kingdom, and may indeed be pre-dynastic.
There are a number of temples that have
been erected upon this site, which contribute
to the glory of its past history. The earliest
relics found are flint instruments, and there
are a number of recoveries from the Middle
Kingdom also. While the famed archeologist
Legrain was in charge of the work of recovery
here, he opened one great pit from which an
unbelievable amount of material was recovered.
In this one find, seven hundred and
fifty large statues were dug up, and more
than twenty thousand smaller objects were
recovered from this same pit. This was
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
largely a Middle Kingdom deposit. It may
be said that the entire history of the land
is seen here, from the archaic age to the
end of the Ptolemaic period.</p>
<p>There are three major ruins that make up
the vast monument of Karnak, which, with
the avenue of ram-headed sphinxes, is almost
a mile in length. Each of these three enclosures
has its own story to tell. The smallest
one is the most northerly, and was built
by Amenhetep the Third. Ramses the Second
added to its structure, and the imposing gate
was built by Ptolemy Euergetes the First.
This magnificent gate is practically all of
the original structure that remains today.
The outline of the foundation of the original
temple may be traced, but its material, with
the exception of the gate, has long since disappeared.</p>
<p>The south enclosure contained the temple
built to the glory of the goddess Mut by
Amenhetep the Third, of which also very
little of the original structure remains. Behind
this temple, however, is a sacred lake,
shaped like a horseshoe, upon which tradition
says the barge of the sacred lady used
to appear. Indeed, there are fellahin in
Egypt today who maintain that at certain
times when the moon is just right, this notable
barge may still be seen if one is fortunate
enough to be on the spot at the right
time. (We regret to say that the times that
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
we were there were never the right ones!)</p>
<p>There were small temples and shrines inside
both of these enclosures where various
kings honoured other deities in the lengthy
pantheon. Some traces of these may still be
seen here and there, and much more may yet
be brought to light by the excavations now
being conducted there by the Department of
Antiquities.</p>
<p>It is the third enclosure which is the great
one, and the really thrilling monument. It
is about 1,500 feet square, so that it is at once
apparent that it is immense. Undoubtedly
it is the largest temple ever constructed by
man. Two million, two hundred and fifty
thousand feet of floor space make quite a
place of worship in any day and age!</p>
<p>The original sanctuary was probably begun
by Usertesen the First, who dedicated
it to Amon-Ra. Having done so, the king
then used the walls, pillars, beams, and all
other available space to carve a record of
his own reign and greatness; not forgetting,
of course, to give Amon-Ra due credit here
and there for such divine aid as the Pharaoh
may have needed from time to time! The
drawings, paintings, and carvings of this
monarch are a fine source of information
concerning his times and peoples.</p>
<p>This seems to have established a precedent
at Karnak, for the original temple was added
to by Thothmes the First, who faithfully followed
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
the example of his predecessor, and
told what a mighty man he also turned out
to be! Then Seti the First followed him, to
be in turn replaced by Thothmes the Third,
and neither neglected to carve the tale of his
power and successes on the additions to the
original temple that Usertesen had started.</p>
<p>The next builder was Amenhetep the Third,
and after him the three successive Ramses
all built extensive votive shrines and temples.
The amount of carving, painting, and hieroglyphics
that covers all this mighty pile of
stone work is almost unbelievable, and leaves
the beholder amazed and somewhat awed.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy section of the standing
ruins is the great hypo-style hall, which
is one of the architectural wonders of the
world. This hall is 171 feet deep and 338
feet in breadth. The roof was supported by
134 mighty columns, set in 16 rows, of which
the two central rows were by far the highest.
The roof of this great hall was 78 feet above
the floor, and the entire structure was covered
with reliefs and painted scenes from the
conquests and lives of the builders.</p>
<p>Here are to be found the most gratifying
evidences of the integrity and accuracy of
the Scripture that the most ardent devotee of
the Bible could desire. The Pharaohs who
appear in the text of Holy Writ are there
on Karnak&rsquo;s walls as well, and this testimony
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
of ancient heathen monarchs is conclusive
and final.</p>
<p>As the kings of antiquity consistently
carved upon the walls, the pillars, and the
beams of Karnak the proud record of their
conquests, it is inevitable that this source of
material should be drawn upon heavily by
the exponent of the Scripture. In a later
chapter we shall return to Karnak again and
again to read these treasured accounts.</p>
<p>There are many other temples of antiquity
that are of almost equal value, such as the
great temple at Luxor. Students have long
been familiar with the nature of the great
pyramids which have also a great contribution
to make to our sources of evidence. It
is to be noted, however, that only an honest
and honorable evaluation of these evidences
is of any aid to the faithful student of the
Scripture.</p>
<p>One of the greatest but most nonsensical
heresies of our generation is the false teaching
that parades under the name of &ldquo;British-Israelism.&rdquo;
This ridiculous fantasy is predicated
upon the false premise that the Great
Pyramid is a prophecy erected under divine
leading. By a weird interpretation of its
mathematical proportions, it is presumed to
portray a prophetic record of coming events.
It is the source of more fantasy than has ever
been derived from any other misapplication
of coincidence!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>The advocates of British-Israel heresy
claim that the pyramids were never used as
burial sites. This is, of course, arrant nonsense.
They were nothing but stupendous
graves.</p>
<p>We have ourselves been in the burial chambers
of the Great Pyramid and have seen
the sarcophagi.</p>
<p>We have had the pleasure of examining
the great stone casket that was taken out of
the pyramid, containing the mummy of the
buried king, as well as the replica thereof
which was put back into this burial chamber
to satisfy the interest of visiting tourists.</p>
<p>We have been in the burial chamber of the
queen and the royal children as well.</p>
<p>We have seen these mummies that came
out of the Great Pyramid, have poked our
way into the treasure room and have seen
some of these recoveries which were made
when the pyramid was entered.</p>
<p>To show something of the interest the
kings of antiquity had in their resting places,
it is recorded on credible ancient authority
that the building of this Great Pyramid occupied
twenty years, and that three hundred
thousand men were employed in the building.
Ten years were occupied in the one task of
quarrying the stone. Another decade passed
by in the erection of the monument. Herodotus
states that the men worked in groups
of ten thousand, laboring three months at a
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
shift. The records of Herodotus contain a
description of the construction of earthen
ramps up which the stones were skidded by
means of wooden machines.</p>
<p>The Cairo Museum contains a number of
very valuable exhibits from this greatest of
all burial mounds. So also has the second
pyramid of Gheza, in turn, yielded its mummies,
as have the others which have since
been breached.</p>
<p>We cannot ignore the great evidence given
by the type of monument composed of the
obelisks, the erection of which delighted the
ancient conquerors. These consisted of
enormous stone shafts that towered into the
air sometimes to a distance of seventy feet.
These great spires were engraved with the
name of the monarch, a description of his
greatness, and some of the more important
records of his reign.</p>
<p>In closing, we must not neglect to mention
also the boundary markers that were so common
in the Assyrian culture. These engraved
stones, often illustrated with sculptured figures
in high relief, are of unique importance
not only because of their written records
but also because of their ubiquity. Throughout
all of the ancient world of Mesopotamia
they seem to have been in general use. Since
they were an important factor in deciding
the title of a section of land, they were carefully
made and preserved. The date factor is
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
generally a certain year of the reign of a
given king, and the historical information
derived from monuments of this type is practically
unlimited. (See <a href="#pl16">Plate 16</a>.)</p>
<p>Also, since the ancients had no hinges,
it was customary in constructing a door to
have it turn upon a pivot. Beneath the door
sill was a hollowed stone customarily called
an ouch. This acted as a bearing which supported
the weight of the door and enabled one
man easily to swing a very heavy structure.
These ouches were generally engraved with
the name of the building, the purpose of the
building and, perhaps, the cost and record of
the construction. (See <a href="#pl17">Plate 17</a>.)</p>
<p>From all these scattered sources, then, we
gather together the unified testimony of multiplied
thousands of men once dead who speak
from the long silence of their forgotten era.
Their united testimony is an unbroken
chorus of assurance for those who are concerned
over the integrity of the text of the
Scripture.</p>
<p>In the bewildering mass of all this evidence
which together would weigh so many tons
that the figure, if computed, would appear
fabulous, there is not one word, one testimony,
or one fact that has contradicted or
disproved a single line of the Holy Bible.</p>

<br />Fragments</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Rome was not built in a day,&rdquo; is a self-evident
truth: but it is equally true that it
was not <i>excavated</i> in a day, either! In fact,
as all visitors to Italy can testify, the Department
of Antiquities is still working on some
of the more ancient sites, and certain of the
most extensive ruins are just beginning to
emerge for the delight of our generation.
Archeology is a very fine exposition of the
truth inherent in the old proverb of science:
&ldquo;Research is the examination of the tenth
decimal place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many stupendous monuments
that have been uncovered with surprising
speed, but the majority of our most valuable
evidence has been derived from long and
patient digging, and is often composed of innumerable
fragments from here and there.
Standing alone, any one of the many items
that appear to be inconsequential would
arouse no interest in the average observer,
and would be passed over without comment.
Such evidence is similar in its accumulative
force to the action of water. A drop, or any
number of single drops of water, attracts very
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
little attention, but when enough of them
combine to form a flood, great cities and
whole nations sit up in alarm and pay strict
attention to the course of the flow.</p>
<p>So it is today with the flood of facts that
make up the great stream of discovery, and
constitute so forceful a demonstration of the
value and accuracy of the Bible. A few facts
from Egypt suddenly fit into the pattern of
certain other events that occurred in Assyria,
and these in turn naturally correlate themselves
with a record inscribed upon a stone
by some king of Moab. Like the pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle, these isolated and apparently
unrelated facts make a complete picture
when they are intelligently assembled, but
careless or ignorant handling can never show
the marvelous pattern in its complete beauty.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will offer a group of
these fragments from here and there, and
show their value to the student who seeks
evidence on the question of the authority of
the Holy Word. Their accumulated force is
irresistible, and their final authority cannot
be refuted. Just as grains of sand make up
a mighty mound when they are assembled
into one great heap or deposit, these fragmentary
facts have an imposing authority
when they are taken together. In support
of this statement, we shall cite the problem
of chronology.</p>
<p>One of the greatest difficulties that has always
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
faced the students of antiquity was the
construction of an accurate and detailed
chronology. The early Egyptians paid no
attention whatever to chronological sequence,
but dated the episodes and events which they
recorded by the year of the contemporary
monarch. Among the Chaldeans and the
Sumerians, however, lists of eponyms were
carefully kept. In the Assyrian meaning of
this word an eponym was an official whose
name was used in a chronological system to
designate a certain year of office. From
these consecutive records of the eponyms,
king-lists of unusual and detailed accuracy
were compiled. A great deal of the difficulty
in harmonizing the chronological factors in
the study of antiquity has recently been
solved by a close study of these canons, which
studies were first begun by Sir Henry Rawlinson.
As an instance, we note that one
such consecutive list gives all of the eponyms
from B. C. 893 to 666.</p>
<p>Another magnificent aid to the Biblical
chronologist is found in the astronomical data
which were so carefully kept at the same historical
period. Through these credible records
we have the material to check the accuracy
of the king-lists that adds to their
tremendous value. For instance, a tablet
has come to us stating that in the eponym
of one Pur-sagali, there was an eclipse of the
sun which took place in the month Sivan.
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
Since Sivan would be composed, according
to our calendar, of the last two weeks of May
and the first two weeks of June, it is easy
to make an astronomical calculation to fix
this date. We are delighted to find that there
was an eclipse of the sun which would have
been visible at Nineveh on June 15, 763 B. C.
With this factor fixed, we can now date all
of the events of that period of antiquity from
these king-lists to the time of the beginning
of the reign of Assur-bani-pal.</p>
<p>Another such tablet, which came from
Babylon, gives us an opportunity to check
back the other way. This tablet merely
states, &ldquo;In the seventh year of the reign
of Cambyses, between the 16th and 17th of
the month Phemenoth, at one hour before
midnight, the moon was obscured in the vicinity
of Babylon by one-half of her diameter
on the north.&rdquo; We then turn to our modern
astronomical sources and learn from them
that there <i>was</i> just such an eclipse of the
moon which would have been visible in
Babylon in the year 522 B. C. Since this was
the seventh year of Cambyses, it follows that
he must have ascended in the year 529.</p>
<p>This is exactly what is demanded by the
Biblical chronology accepted at our present
time. Incidentally, by correlating the prophecies
and history of the Old Testament to
the proved chronological points in these records,
archeology has vindicated the historical
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
and traditional acceptance of those dates
which criticism unsuccessfully disputed. The
kings of Israel and Judah, with the writing
prophets of each monarch&rsquo;s reign, may now
be correlated into this accredited system of
chronology. When this is done, the traditional
and accepted dates for the prophecies
of the Old Testament which orthodox scholarship
has always maintained, are established
beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>In the confused condition of the Egyptian
chronology it is difficult to dogmatize concerning
the exact identification of certain
pharaohs whose records are contained in the
Sacred Text, but who are not identified by
their prenomen in Holy Writ.</p>
<p>A good deal of this confusion, however, is
being dissipated with surprising rapidity due
to the recovery of some hitherto unknown
sources. The tendency of our present day
is to concede that the Pharaoh Thotmes,
whose name is more commonly given as Tuthmosis,
was the pharaoh of the Oppression.
There is a great deal of reliable authority
for adopting this view. This mighty sovereign,
whose history we have partly covered
in connection with his sister, wife and domineering
queen, Hatshepsut, in the portion
dealing with the times of Moses, according
to the best chronologist, reigned fifty-one
years. He died in 1447 B. C., and was succeeded
by Amenhetep the Second. This fact
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
would make it practically certain that the
latter monarch was the pharaoh of the Exodus.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of gratifying demonstration
in the new chronology which, being
purged from the gross errors that naturally
resulted from chronological differences
inevitable to pioneers in Egyptology, has
brought great comfort and aid to the orthodox
believer in the Old Testament. There
were almost as many different dates given
by the critics for the Exodus from Egypt as
there were critics. It may be noted in passing
that one of the major difficulties of criticism
and one of its foundational weaknesses
is to be seen in the fact that each individual
critic is his own highest authority. The only
finality that criticism recognizes is the dogmatic
decision of a particular individual to
believe one way or the other.</p>
<p>So it is rather hard to say that criticism
in general held to any certain thing. The
consensus of opinion, as far as such can be
gathered from criticism, however, would
make the date of the Exodus not any earlier
than 1220 B. C.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>The <i>new</i> chronology, derived from archeological
research, has utterly and finally upset
these critical conclusions. The Exodus
can be credibly dated now to within a span
of ten years. The earlier probability is 1447
B. C. and the latest possible time would be
1437. It may be said that if we consider the
archeological sources alone, there is a possible
spread of thirty years, but no more.
Even if we make the most liberal concessions,
the Exodus must be fitted into the record
between 1447 and 1417 B. C. Allowing
then for the years of wandering in the wilderness,
the fall of Jericho occurred with a possible
spread of ten years, between 1407 and
1397. The earlier date is now accepted as by
far the most credible. We may state almost
with finality that Jericho was destroyed in
1407 B. C., and remain secure in that conclusion.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Tuthmosis died in 1447, the
reign of Amenhetep the Second would have
ended in 1421. These perplexing seals of
Amenhetep, if they have not been derived by
intrusion, would thus have had a sufficient
time to reach Jericho in connection with some
official business of the kingdom in the forty
years elapsing between the Exodus and the
assault on the Canaanite city.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that Josephus makes
a passing reference to the statement of the
Egyptian historian, Manetho, that the pharaoh
of the Exodus was Amenophis. Amenophis
is another form of the name Amenhetep,
which would add a great deal of authority
to our present conclusions. Josephus is not
willing to acknowledge the dependability of
Manetho, due to the fact that Manetho came
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
so long after the event. But since the Egyptian
historian preceded Josephus by some
three hundred years, the older authority
would seem to be at least as dependable as
Josephus! Incidentally, this fact, if accepted,
would be a confirmation of the accepted
date for the Tel-el-amarna tablets with the
reign of Amenhetep.</p>
<p>The final word as to the date, based upon
authoritative evidence derived from the pottery
culture as given by Dr. Garstang, makes
the destruction of Jericho to have been not
later than 1400 B. C. Thus the pendulum of
opinion and discussion has now swung back
to the point where we can authoritatively
stand upon the earlier conclusions of the Book
of Joshua and accept its credibility without
the slightest question.</p>
<p>Most of us can remember how recently it
was the fashion for the opponents of the
Bible to laugh at those who believed in the
historicity of Joshua&rsquo;s strange conquest of
the Canaanite city of Jericho. The collapse
of the walls of that ancient city has long been
a source of mystery to the scientific student,
and of hilarity to the unbeliever. The faith
of the intelligent is vindicated, however, and
the laughter of the unbeliever is stilled, by
the exhaustive work that archeology has done
in the vicinity of Jericho.</p>
<p>The site has been explored a number of
times, but the most comprehensive and conclusive
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
work was done by the 1933 expedition
that was headed by Dr. Garstang. The
walls of Jericho were mighty, and as long
as they stood the city was impregnable to the
armed forces of antiquity. The unusual structure
of Jericho&rsquo;s walls was manifested when
they were uncovered from the dirt and debris
of centuries. The word &ldquo;walls&rdquo; is properly
given in its plural form as there were outer
and inner walls that entirely encircled the
city. There was, first of all, surrounding the
city completely, an outer wall, which seemed
to have been held up as much by faith as
by gravity!</p>
<p>Ever since we had the first opportunity of
personally examining the geology of Jericho
and noting the insecure structure upon which
those walls were builded, our own private
wonder has not been that the walls fell down;
rather we have been bewildered by speculating
as to what in the name of physics ever
held them up! Perhaps it was the binding
of the buildings that anchored the outer wall
to the inner wall, and made a sort of tripod
structure of the whole, which accounted for
this phenomenon. Some fourteen feet back
from the outer wall and roughly paralleling
the convolutions of the former, there was an
inner wall of the same height as the outer
one. Across these two walls great beams had
been laid, and dwellings constructed upon
this unique foundation. The outer wall was
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
pierced by the one gate, in exact accordance
with the description in the Book of Joshua.</p>
<p>There is no natural explanation to account
for the unique evidence of the collapse of
these walls. They were not undermined by
military engineers, for they all seem to have
collapsed around the entire circumference of
the city at one and the same time. They
were not shaken down by an earthquake. This
would have resulted in a haphazard piling
of the wall material in a number of different
directions. It seems as though a mighty blast
had been set off in the center of the city,
thrusting the walls outward, in what might
roughly be described as a circle. This collapse
of the walls naturally resulted in the
wrecking of the houses builded thereon.
When the preliminary clearance had been
made and the excavators came down to these
great ruins, every demand of the Book of
Joshua was satisfactorily met by the conditions
there uncovered.</p>
<p>In the remnants of the houses found in
Jericho there was overwhelming evidence of
a systematic destruction by fires that were
set to sweep the entire ruin. Among the
most interesting and significant of the
charred evidences were the great stores of
burned grain which showed that even the
food of Jericho had been dedicated to the
fire, as Joshua had commanded.</p>
<p>When the discoveries of Jericho were first
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
publicized, Dr. Garstang could find only one
apparent contradiction between the record
of Joshua and the evidences in the city. That
was in the time factor, or chronology, that
was involved. In the cemetery of Jericho
upon its excavation, there were found two
seals of the Pharaoh Amenhetep the Third.
Since this monarch reigned probably at least
a hundred years after the time of Joshua, it
was difficult to reconcile the apparent discrepancy.
The apparent difficulty, however,
dissolves when we consider the possibility of
later intrusion.</p>
<p>Before the excavations at Jericho could
begin, it was necessary for the workers to
clear away the remains of a fortress of Ramses,
the monarch who headed the nineteenth
dynasty, which in turn followed that of the
dynasty of Amenhetep the Third. Since this
site had been temporarily used by the Egyptians
two hundred years after its destruction,
it is highly probable that it might also have
been temporarily visited by them the century
immediately following its destruction.
If the presence of two seals of Amenhetep
are to be taken as a date factor in view of
the fact that burials at that site were by
intrusion, then a great case could be made
for a later date by the ruined fortress of
Ramses.</p>
<p>The pharaoh who ruled in the day when
Joshua led the conquest of Canaan was most
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
probably Tuthmosis the Third, who reigned
contemporarily with the Queen Hatshepsut
until he was sufficiently entrenched to overthrow
her dominion. This queen, as all the
evidence most clearly suggests, was most
probably the one who drew Moses out of
the Nile. The contemporary and collateral
evidence is fairly conclusive, so that this fact
is generally accepted. Relegating the one
anomalous discovery, then, to the probability
of intrusion, we find that Jericho, perhaps
more than any other site in antiquity, has
vindicated the record of the Old Testament
text.</p>
<p>In this very connection, it is interesting
to note how the queen Hatshepsut came into
the record, and first interested the student
of apologetics. The eminent archeologist,
Flinders Petrie, found a tablet on the slope
of Mt. Sinai which was written in an archaic
script that baffled every attempt to decipher
its mystery for nearly thirty years. But at
long last Professor Hubert Grimme, who held
the chair of Semitic languages at the University
of Munster, made out two words.
One of these was the ancient Hebrew name
for God, which in this form of writing appeared
as &ldquo;JAHUA.&rdquo; The other word that
Dr. Grimme succeeded in reading was &ldquo;HATSHEPSUT,&rdquo;
who was known from her monuments
and obelisk.</p>
<p>With this key, the table was quickly deciphered,
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
and was ascribed to Moses. The
text as it appeared follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I am the son of Hatshepsut</p>
<p class="t0">overseer of the mine workers of sin</p>
<p class="t0">chief of the temple of Mana Jahua of Sinai</p>
<p class="t0">thou oh Hatshepsut</p>
<p class="t0">wast kind to me and drew me out</p>
<p class="t0">of the waters of the Nile</p>
<p class="t0">hast placed me in the temple (or palace).&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>On the reverse were directions for locating
the place where the writer reported he had
buried certain tablets of stone, which he had
broken in his anger. Since all the landmarks
the writer used to identify the place of burial
have disappeared, nothing has so far come
from the search that resulted when this tablet
was at last read.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this queen Hatshepsut left her
mark upon the age in which she lived, as
she was one of the most persistently determined
women who ever appeared upon
the pages of ancient history. There is a remarkably
complete record of her history and
her imperial reign which may be read today
in the relics of her times and in the ruins of
the great works which she caused to be constructed.</p>
<p>Her important place illustrates one of the
difficulties of chronology, which we have
previously mentioned. Her background is
clear and undisputed. When Tuthmosis the
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
First died, his son and heir Tuthmosis the
Second succeeded to the throne. He was a
physical and mental weakling, and very little
is known of him from the monuments of old.
But he married his half-sister Hatshepsut,
and started a train of events that had surprising
consequences. Incidentally, it was the
custom for Egyptians to marry in the closest
family ties, and brother and sister more often
wed than not. In view of this famous lady&rsquo;s
character and later conduct, it is highly probable
that the king had no choice in marrying
his sister, but was led to the slaughter
whether he would or not! At any rate, he
died very soon after the wedding, and the
widow Hatshepsut declared herself queen.
To make her position secure, she married
her young stepson and half-brother, Tuthmosis
the Third, who was the legal and rightful
heir to the throne. During his boyhood
the queen reigned in undisputed power, and
developed the country in a surprising manner.</p>
<p>She was a feminist with a vengeance, and
called herself KING Hatshepsut, and stated
that she was a god and as such was entitled
to worship and obedience. What is more,
she made it stick! Since she could not lead
her armies in person, she pursued the ways
of peace, and the troubled land had rest and
prospered. Some of the greatest building
operations of the ancient world were begun
and finished under her direction and patronage.</p>

<p>When her husband-brother-consort became
of age, he naturally rebelled against her usurpation.
He gathered a company of adventurous
nobles about him and forced the queen
to abdicate, after which she disappeared under
circumstances which would have interested
Scotland Yard, if that noted institution
had been in existence in that day and place!
The ambitious young king took the name of
Tuthmosis the Third, and left a brilliant record
as a conqueror and builder. Counting
the twenty-one years he lived as co-regent
with Hatshepsut, he ruled the land fifty-three
years, which was an enviable span for those
warlike days.</p>
<p>If the present accepted chronology is right,
he came to the throne in 1501 B. C. and
died in the year 1447. This would have
made him the Pharaoh of the Oppression!
In which case, the queen Hatshepsut would
have unconsciously offended him in elevating
Moses to a place of prominence and power,
which might explain why Moses felt it necessary
to flee from Egypt when he was in
trouble. At any rate, out of this tangled
skein of human conduct and ambition, some
present help is offered to the learning of our
day by the known facts that have been clearly
established from the relics of this embattled
couple. The name of the queen Hatshepsut
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
was abhorrent to her brother-husband-regent-successor;
and he tried to obliterate
it wherever it appeared. But she had
built so many great works and had left such
ample records that his actions in this matter
came to nought, and she lives today to shed
the assurance of probability upon the record
of Moses.</p>
<p>We have seen her obelisks, her records and
some of the ruins of her great works, and
the entire pattern is of a piece with the demands,
both chronological and ethnological,
of the text of the Scripture. It is apparent
that not only dead <i>men</i>, but also dead <i>women</i>,
may tell tales, if their voices are heeded and
the ears of the listener are not stopped with
the wax of infidelity and disbelief.</p>
<p>The amazing and scrupulous accuracy
which is maintained by the Old Testament
in its historical statements is once again
demonstrated by the record of Ahaz as it is
given in the Old Testament and found on
the monuments in Assyria. We read in II
Kings and the sixteenth chapter, these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son
of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham king of
Judah began to reign.</p>
<p>Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began
to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem,
and did not that which was right in the
sight of the Lord his God, like David his
father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>But he walked in the way of the kings of
Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through
the fire, according to the abominations of the
heathen, whom the Lord cast out from before
the children of Israel.</p>
<p>And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the
high places, and on the hills, and under every
green tree.</p>
<p>Then Rezin king of Syria, and Pekah son
of Remaliah king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem
to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but
could not overcome him.</p>
<p>At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered
Elath to Syria, and dwelt there unto this day.</p>
<p>So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser
king of Assyria saying, I am thy servant and
thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand
of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of
the king of Israel, which rise up against me.</p>
<p>And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was
found in the house of the Lord, and in the
treasures of the king&rsquo;s house, and sent it for
a present to the king of Assyria.</p>
<p>And the king of Assyria hearkened unto
him: for the king of Assyria went up against
Damascus, and took it, and carried the people
of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The visit of Ahaz which closes this record
was made in 732 B. C. Tiglath-pileser has
left his own story of these stirring events and
has called Ahaz by name upon his monument.
The unfortunate action of Ahaz in calling for
Assyrian aid against his enemies Pekah king
of Israel and Rezin king of Syria, resulted,
according to Tiglath-pileser&rsquo;s account, in his
invasion of both Syria and Palestine. From
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
thence he carried away into captivity the two
tribes of Reuben and Gath, and the half tribe
of Manasseh. The distress of Israel was not
ended until Hoshea, shortly afterward, became
the new king of Israel. As a matter
of policy he formally accepted the yoke of
Assyria and became the vassal of Tiglath-pileser.</p>
<p>In the Assyrian Room of the British Museum,
Wall Cases 14 to 18 contain a valuable
collection of inscribed bowls, ostraca, and
fragments of records which extend from the
days of Assur-resh-shi, down to the end of
the Assyrian dynasty. Among them are fragmentary
inscriptions from the reign of Tiglath-pileser
the Third. He is known in the
Scriptures also by his Babylonian name of
Pul. In I Chronicles 5:26 both names are
found in the one verse, as though the scribe
were anxious that the identification should
be complete:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit
of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tiglath-pileser
king of Assyria, and he carried
them away, even the Reubenites and the Gadites,
and the half tribe of Manasseh, and
brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and
Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tiglath-pileser again appears under the name
of Pul in II Kings 15:19:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Pul the king of Assyria came against
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand
talents of silver, that his hand might be with
him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the twenty-ninth verse of this chapter,
however, his Assyrian name is given alone,
as is done in the sixteenth chapter.</p>
<p>In the above cited wall cases, exhibit K
2751, is an inscription of Tiglath-pileser&rsquo;s
setting forth some of his conquests, and an
account of certain of his building operations.
Among the tributary kings who accepted his
yoke, he <i>specifically mentions Ahaz king of
Judah</i>.</p>
<p>Modern man is so used to the phenomena
that make up the miracle of our modern living
that such fascinating possessions as this
are not generally appreciated and properly
valued. Here, however, we hear again the
voice of a man who died in the year 727
B. C. The phenomenon is seen in the fact
that in spite of the indescribable vandalism
and wreckage wrought by those intervening
ages, a fragment of clay persisted, and remained
in existence until it could be uncovered
from the dust heaps of antiquity by
<i>the one generation that desperately needed its
testimony and was able to interpret and prize
its record</i>!</p>
<p>Here indeed is a dead man who tells tales,
and who tells them with such authority and
accuracy that the mouth of criticism is
stopped and the Word of God completely
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
vindicated. Incidentally, Tiglath-pileser&rsquo;s
record corroborates the prophecy of Isaiah,
concerning the destruction of both Israel and
Syria, because they had joined their forces
to make war upon Judah.</p>
<p>This prophecy is given at length in the
seventh chapter of Isaiah and was the instance
of introducing the greater prophecy
of the final redemption of the people with
the coming of Messiah. He was to be identified,
according to Isaiah, by means of the
miracle of the virgin birth.</p>
<p>When Omri, the general of the armies of
Israel, was elevated by popular acclaim to
the throne of dominion, he climaxed an astonishing
career that left a deep impression upon
antiquity. At the beginning of his reign the
nation was divided in its allegiance and this
division resulted in a civil war that was bitter,
though brief. The power and might of
Omri quickly pacified and subdued the land,
which accepted his dominion, and for twelve
years his hand guided the helm of the ship
of state. One of his earlier acts was to buy
the hill of Samaria for a sum that is given
as two talents of silver, which would be in
the neighborhood of $4,000 in our reckoning.
So impressive was his personality that from
his day on to the end of the kingdom, the
land of Israel was generally known among
the Assyrian peoples as the Land of Omri.</p>
<p>On the black monolith for instance, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
was set up by Shalmaneser the king of Assyria,
there are many sculptured pictures
which illustrate the text of this priceless
historical record. One of the scenes shows
that among the conquered rulers, one is entitled
&ldquo;Jehu the son of Omri.&rdquo; A record is
made of the silver, gold, lead, vessels of
gold, and of other materials that Jehu brought
in tribute to Shalmaneser. (See <a href="#pl18">Plate 18</a>.)
This black obelisk may be seen in the Nimrud
Central Saloon of the British Museum in London.
That this was a general is seen from the
fact that on the nine-sided prism which gives
the record of Sargon concerning his conquests
in Palestine, the great Assyrian lists the people
of Israel whom he calls &ldquo;Bit-Khu-um-ri-a&rdquo;
(Omri-land), among other subdued races.
Omri was succeeded on the throne by Ahab,
who was a young man when he came to the
throne. He left an unenviable record of
apostasy and idolatry, but was none-the-less
a courageous and able administrator whose
work strengthened the realm greatly. In
the twenty-two years of his reign the Word
of God was ignored and unbelief swept over
the land. In his day the first persecution
of God&rsquo;s people, which was directed against
their ministry, began when his wife Jezebel
caused the slaughter of the prophets.</p>
<p>The entire career of Ahab occupies considerable
space in the records of the Old
Testament and is almost as prominent in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
monuments of antiquity. One of the most
outstanding and notable of his early acts
was the famous overthrow of Benhadad, the
king of Syria. The invasions of Israel by
Benhadad are fully covered in the historical
texts of the Old Testament, so they need no
recapitulation here. When the Syrian king
suffered an overwhelming and crushing defeat
at the hands of Ahab, he submitted himself
to the king of Israel with a humble plea
for mercy. In spite of the denunciation of
the prophet, who warned that Benhadad
would bring disaster upon the realm, Ahab
restored him to his Syrian dominion and
made a covenant of brotherhood with him.
Later on, Ahab and Benhadad united in a
rebellion against their Assyrian overlord in
one of the most disastrous acts of his career.
The battle that decided the campaign was
fought at Karkar.</p>
<p>In the British Museum, the Nimrud Central
Saloon exhibits a stele of Shalmaneser
the Third which bears the identifying number
of 88. The inscription sets forth the
names, titles, and ancestry of the king and
gives a complete account of several of his
military adventures. He states that in the
sixth year of his reign, he battled against
certain allies who had rebelled against his
authority. Among them he lists &ldquo;Ahab of
the land of Israel.&rdquo; Shalmaneser tells how
he defeated this coalition and slew fourteen
thousand of the Syrian warriors in one great
battle.</p>

<p>On the monolith of Shalmaneser the record
begun on this stele is further continued.
This battle, according to Shalmaneser&rsquo;s
chronology, would be about 854 B. C. This
Benhadad is known on the Assyrian monuments
variously by the names of Hadad-ezer
and Hadad-idri. He is authenticated by the
finest type of historical proof that the most
carping critic could demand. Incidentally,
Benhadad is one of the forty-seven kings
mentioned in our preliminary remarks, who
were supposed to be legendary characters,
until archeology called them forth from the
dead to testify in their own behalf.</p>
<p>Ahab was one of the most industrious
builders who ever occupied the throne of
Israel. Although he lacked the resources
of Solomon, there are a number of records
in the Scripture that shed light upon his
architectural interests. In I Kings 22:39 all
of this activity is summarized in their brief
epitome:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all
that he did, and the ivory house which he
made, and all the cities that he built, are
they not written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hill of Samaria, which Omri had
purchased, passed by inheritance to Ahab.
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
The ivory palace that is mentioned in
I Kings 22:39 was built on this site. Solomon
may have had his throne of ivory, but
Ahab improved upon that idea, as this text
seems to imply. This summer palace which
he built for himself and Jezebel on the crest
of the hill of Samaria has been the scene of
recent expeditions. A great deal of archeological
industry has been expended in reconstructing
the beauty and marvel of this
palace of Ahab. It has been discovered that
the walls were decorated with ivory carvings,
and that much of the furniture was inlaid
with ivory. This valuable substance was
used with a profligate hand to construct one
of the most splendid edifices of all antiquity.</p>
<p>Some of the most skilled craftsmen of human
history were employed by this enterprise.
To show something of the ability of
these ancient artists, we present a photograph
of the figure of an ivory lion which
came from the site of Ahab&rsquo;s palace. The
illustration is magnified four times, but tiny
as this priceless relic is, the lines and perfection
of the carving cannot be excelled by any
craftsman today.</p>
<p>The Harvard expedition under Dr. Reisner,
and the joint expedition of 1931, both made
delighted comment on the unprecedented
perfection of the structure of this great palace.
It covered an area between seven and
eight acres in extent; the masonry of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
building was no less than marvelous in the
perfection of its structure and joining. Concerning
these ivory miniatures, inlays, and
friezes, the leader of the expedition said,
&ldquo;These ivories are the most charming example
of miniature art ever found on an
Israelite site.&rdquo; By referring to the ivory lion
in <a href="#pl19">Plate 19</a> the reader can see
that this is indeed the fact.</p>
<p>The excavations at Samaria have been going
on since the Harvard expedition began
in 1908. Among the valuable finds from
the ivory palace of Ahab must be listed a
group of seventy-five ostraca. These ancient
fragments of pottery, inscribed and engraved
with the homely affairs of the daily
life of Ahab&rsquo;s time, contain the same script
as is found on the Moabite stone.</p>
<p>This great relic of antiquity has had a
fascinating but unfortunate history in itself.
It will always be a matter of sincere regret
that the first discoverer of the Moabite stone
did not make a copy of its complete text.
The Moabite stone states that Ahab reigned
forty years. The Scripture record, however,
makes his reign to be twenty-two years. According
to the credible chronology of II Kings,
upon the death of Ahab, his son, Jehoram,
ascended to the throne and reigned twelve
years. Mesha, who had accepted the lordship
of the able Ahab, rebelled against the
weaker son.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>At some time during this reign, Mesha,
a minor king of Moab, tired of paying to
Israel the annual tribute of one hundred
thousand lambs, plus one hundred thousand
rams, with the wool thereof. He rebelled
against the overlord of Israel and successfully
threw off the yoke. On an enormous
stele which was erected at Dhiban by the
successful king we find these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I Mesha, son of Chemosh-melech, king of
Moab, the Dibonite. My father reigned over
Moab 30 years and I reigned after my father.
I have made this monument for Chemosh
at Qorhah, a monument of salvation for he
saved me from all invaders and let me see
my desire upon all my enemies. Omri was
king of Israel, and he oppressed Moab many
days, for Chemosh was angry with his land.
His son, Ahab followed him and he also said:
I will oppress Moab. In my days Chemosh
said: I will see my desire on him and his house
and Israel surely shall perish forever. Omri
took the land of Medeba and dwelt in it during
his days and half the days of his son,
altogether 40 years. But Chemosh gave it
back in my days. I built Baal-Meon and
made therein the ditches; I built Kirjathaim.
The men of God dwelt in the land of Ataroth
from of old, and the king of Israel built there
the city of Ataroth; but I made war against
the city and took it. And I slew all the people
of the city, for the pleasure of Chemosh and of
Moab and I brought back from the Arel of
Dodah and bore him before Chemosh in
Qerioth. And I placed therein the men of
Sharon and the men of Mehereth. And
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
Chemosh said unto me: Go, seize Nebo of
Israel and I went in the night and fought
against it from the break of dawn till noon;
and I took it, slew all of them, 7,000 men and
boys, women and girls and female slaves,
for to Ashtar-Chemosh I devoted them. And
I took from thence the Arels of Yahwah
and bore them before Chemosh. Now the
king of Israel had built Jahaz and he dwelt
in it while he waged war against me, but
Chemosh drove him out from before me....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When this great monument was first discovered
in 1868, its value was of course not
appreciated and no copy of the text was made.
The Museum of Berlin heard of it and moved
for its purchase. An employe of the French
Consulate heard of the negotiations, and offered
a large bribe for the possession of the
stone. The Turkish officials then interfered.
The superstitious Arabs, believing that the
monument must have some magical value,
broke it into a number of fragments and distributed
the pieces as amulets, or charms. A
French agent, however, industriously pursued
these fragments and with the help of a
squeeze which he had made, reconstructed
the major portion of the writings. The ancient
name of Jehovah occurring on this text
was an additional delight to these students of
antiquity.</p>
<p>Certain small cities that Israel had wrested
from Moab were returned to Mesha at the
time of this rebellion. Jehoram, and Jehoshaphat,
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
the kings of Judah, later battled against
the increasing power of Moab and administered
a crushing defeat to the Moabites
sometime after the successful uprising that
is recorded here in this text.</p>
<p>Among the ostraca excavated at Samaria,
were some that mentioned many of the historical
personages of the Old Testament,
which also enhanced their value in the eyes
of archeologists.</p>
<p>The later expedition to Samaria which was
working in 1931, apparently reached the
foundations of the first buildings of Omri.
They have left a record stating, &ldquo;No remains
earlier than the building of Omri are to be
found upon this site.&rdquo; This being so, we
cannot question the statement of the text
that Omri was the original builder on the
crest of the hill of Samaria, which fact is
in itself of considerable importance to the
subject of our present study. The question
has been raised as to what the effect would
have been on the problem of the integrity
of the text of the Scripture if this site had
proved to have been like the other regions
excavated, and was occupied by many older
and underlying ruins! The simple answer
is that such a discovery was <i>not</i> made; and
the evidence that has been derived is of such
nature that this portion of the sacred Book
<i>must</i> be accepted by the intelligent and informed
scholar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>These fragmentary events and references
are of as much value as are the individual
bricks that make up the mass of a wall or a
building. One or two standing alone would
be relatively unimportant, but when scores
of such evidences are gathered into a composite
unit, they offer a formidable and impressive
structure of evidence that is extremely
difficult to refute. Although it has
been the custom to construct the critical
argument against the integrity of God&rsquo;s Word
from imagined <i>minor</i> errors in the text, so
intrenched is critical dogmatism that nothing
but a <i>major</i> rebuttal will be heeded. Happily,
a major structure may be erected from minor
materials: and thus these <i>fragments</i> serve
their destined purpose.</p>

<br />The Rebirth of an Empire</h2>
<p>Among the ancient races that are catalogued
in the lists which appear in the pages
of the Old Testament, the most important one
in the presentation of this thesis is the Hittite
race. In the heyday of their brief popularity
the higher critics indulged in an orgy of refutation
concerning these sections of the Scripture.
Since the Hittites are mentioned forty-eight
times in the pages of the Bible, if it
could be proved that these people were fictitious
in character, the critical case against
the Old Testament would be demonstrated
beyond question. It would almost seem as
though the writers of the ancient word had
invited this contest with deliberate intention.
It is impossible to justify the manifold appearances
of the Hittites in the Sacred Word,
if they were not an actual people.</p>
<p>In addition to the many other references,
in the various lists of races given as occupying
different portions of the ancient world,
the Bible mentions the Hittite peoples twenty-one
separate and distinct times. The eminent
dean of higher criticism, the late Canon
Driver, ascribes these historical catalogs of
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
peoples to imagination and fiction, and refers
to them in such words as these, &ldquo;The
Hittites are also regularly mentioned in the
rhetorical lists.&rdquo; Canon Driver is careful to
note that these lists of peoples are found
in that section of the Scripture which he calls
the &ldquo;Elohistic Manuscript.&rdquo; It is not hard
to understand that one who starts with the
assumption of incredibility, would have trouble
believing in the reality of the statements
in a document so treated.</p>
<p>The writers of the Scripture, in their dealings
with the subject of this forgotten people,
sketch an amazing picture indeed. They portray
a warlike, powerful, well organized race
whose genius at colonization and military
ability combined to win for them a veritable
world empire. The center of their dominion
was Syria, but from thence they reached out
to lay their yoke upon Egypt, to overrun
Palestine, and to force the early Assyrians
to pay tribute to their might and power.</p>
<p>It seems almost inconceivable that in the
voluminous records of antiquity there should
have been no single word concerning this
mighty race. For until the closing decades
of the nineteenth century, the Hittites had
no place in secular history. They were preserved
to the memory of man, simply and
only because of the forty-eight Old Testament
references which we have previously
mentioned. The scholarly critics argued that
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
it would be impossible for a world empire
to disappear from history without leaving
a single trace. They insisted that if a race
of men had ever lived who dominated the
world of their day, common sense would
incline us to the conclusion that they could
not suddenly fade away from the memory of
man and leave no evidence of their existence.</p>
<p>But they did! From the very beginning
of this argument, it should have been apparent
that there were two ways to approach
the problem. One way was the method
which was adopted by the higher critics,
namely, to assume that the Old Testament
is fallible. Adopting as the grounds of investigation
the pre-conceived conclusion that
the records of the Old Testament are fallacious
and incredible, the critics then proceeded
to search for proof of this basic assumption.
By dogmatically asserting that the
Old Testament was not historical, but that
much of its contents consisted of folklore and
myth, inductive conclusions were offered as
proof of this presumption.</p>
<p>It did not seem to occur to the higher critical
scholars that a better way to study the
Word would have been to concede the historicity
of the text until it was disproved
by evidence. This, of course, has ever been
the method used by the orthodox student
of the Word. We might say in passing that
this is not only the intelligent technique but
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
is also the safer process. To say the very
least, it saves the embarrassment that inevitably
comes to him who arrays himself against
the integrity of the Word of God!</p>
<p>The first appearance of the Hittites in the
Bible is in the fifteenth chapter of the Book
of Genesis, verse twenty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the
Rephaims.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is perhaps the very earliest coincidence
of archeology with the records of the Scripture.
In the various lists of races who were
to be displaced by Israel, according to the
covenant God made with Abraham, the Hittites
are frequently named. Without any
reservation or qualification whatever, this
text which we have just cited states that the
Hittites were Canaanites. According to Genesis
10:15, the Canaanitish people came
through the line of Sidon and Heth. It is
apparent also from Genesis 10:6, where
Canaan the son of Ham first comes into the
record, that these Hittites, if they had existed,
would have been akin to the early population
of Chaldea and Babylon. It is an
interesting fact to note that the monuments
of antiquity which have restored these Hittites
to their proper place in secular history,
show them to have had a mixture of Semitic
and Mongolian characteristics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>In the various appearances of these people
in the Old Testament records, it is to be noted
that several characters married Hittite wives.
Bathsheba, who was the mother of Solomon,
and thus infused a Gentile strain into the
genealogy of Mary, who was the mother of
our Lord, was a Hittite woman. In I Kings
11:1, it is also stated that Solomon, among
his many political marriages, had taken to
himself wives from among the Hittites.</p>
<p>These people, although unknown in the
orderly annals of human history, might have
been recognized had the scholarly ability of
earlier generations been able correctly to
interpret obsolete systems of writings. The
Assyrians called them the &ldquo;Khatti.&rdquo; In the
Egyptian inscriptions they are known as the
&ldquo;Kheta.&rdquo; The fact that these names referred
to the Hittites was not known until the Hittite
inscriptions themselves were read and
interpreted and the fact of their reality established.
It is to be regretted that in a
work as short as this one we have not room
to recapitulate their long and fascinating
history. The romance of their recovery of
their rightful place in the annals of human
conduct is all that we can present in this
chapter. They were thrust by human ignorance
into the outer darkness of forgotten
things, but we can trace the hand of God
in bringing them back into the light of remembrance
and establishing them in their
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
proper place of glory and prominence among
the empires of antiquity.</p>
<p>Without hesitation we would offer this as
the perfect demonstration of the manner in
which Almighty God cares for His Word.
When His Book is assailed and discredited,
He will, if need be, raise the dead to establish
the integrity of the Inspired Record. It
might be noted in passing that secular history
is now often corrected by archeology. The
misunderstandings and errors which were
alleged to appear in the Bible, and which are
common to the production of a purely human
document, are being done away with as we
read them again in the light of the monuments.
Wherever such correction has been
made, it has had the effect of bringing secular
history into complete harmony with the
Bible. So in restoring the empire of the Hittites
to the staid columns of accredited history,
the Divine Record is again confirmed.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that these Hittites should
appear in the Ancient Word, as they largely
parallel the history of the Hebrew kingdom
in point of time. From the days of Abraham
to the end of the kingdom of Israel, the Hittites
and the Hebrews walked side by side
and hand in hand. During that time Hittites
and Israelites alike are the enemies of Egypt.
Alike they battled against Babylon and Assyria,
they intermarried, had treaties and
covenants each with the other, and had a
well developed system of commerce between
the nations.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>King Solomon, the merchant prince, had
developed business relations with all of the
many chieftains and kings of the Hittite peoples,
and had a well developed trade in the
horses and chariots for which the Hittites
were famous in their day. (See <a href="#pl20">Plate 20</a>.)
This coincidence of affairs began when Abraham
consummated the first commercial transaction
that is mentioned in human history.
Before Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees to begin
his strange pilgrimage, the Hittites were
already established in Canaan. It must not be
thought that Abraham at that time was the
ancient prototype of our modern hobo, wandering
from point to point with no estate! The
pastoral pursuits of Abraham had built up
for him flocks and herds that made him enormously
wealthy. He was an able strategist,
and his military skill, combined with his personal
valor, had elevated him to a high position
of power and influence.</p>
<p>In the land of Canaan he was treated with
honor and admiration as befitted his station
and position. His armed retainers constituted
a formidable army for that day, and this
trained manpower compelled respect for
Abraham, the wandering prince. When
Sarah died, the Hittites were in possession
of the land and Abraham recognized the
validity of their title when he opened the
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
negotiations for a burial plot for Sarah, by
defining himself as a stranger and a sojourner
in their land. With typical oriental courtesy
in bargaining, the Hittites replied to his request
for a burying place for his dead wife by
saying, &ldquo;Hear us, my lord, thou art a mighty
prince among us,&rdquo; and they offered him
freely and without price the choice of a plot
for a sepulchre. Abraham designated the
cave of Machpelah as his choice and offered
to pay the full value of the site. This courtesy,
of course, was expected of him. Though
it had been offered as a free gift, it would
have been a breach of manners of the worst
type, according to the customs of that day,
for him to have accepted the gift.</p>
<p>It will be noted in this account in Genesis
that when Abraham weighed out the requested
price of four hundred shekels of silver,
the statement was made that it was the
shekel which was the current money with
the merchants. The sum was equivalent to
about $300 in our present system of values.
This is the first reference made to coinage,
and it fits in beautifully with the archeological
indications that the Hittites were the
inventors of the principle of coining both
gold and silver as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>From this first moment of their contact
with Abraham there is no period of Hebrew
history, up to the time of the fall of Samaria,
where the people of Israel lost contact with
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
the nation of the Hittites. Their mercenary
soldiers became captains in the army of David
and Solomon, and they were occasionally allied
in important battles in which the people
of Israel fought side by side with them. It
is amazing that the critics, in the face of the
tremendous emphasis laid upon the Hittite
empire by the writers of the Scripture, did
not exercise some discretion in their repudiation
of the historicity of this people. Even
while the tongues of the unbelieving were
clamoring with loud denunciations of the
text of the Word of God, Libya, Syria, and
Asia Minor in general exhibited magnificent
sculpture, incised stones, and monuments
written in a strange system of hieroglyphics
that none had been able to read. These
proved later to be the records of the Hittite
peoples as they themselves had cut them with
their own hands.</p>
<p>We shall later refer to the great work of
Dr. A. H. Sayce in deciphering these hieroglyphics.
His achievement in that instance
was, in the annals of human history, one of
the greatest triumphs of pure reason. Before
this was done, however, the Hittites had
begun to stretch themselves and stir in the
tomb of oblivion. Their long sleep was ended
and they began to rise from the dead, when
experts in Egyptology read the record of
Ramses the Second. It is not too much to
say that these early discoveries threw the
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
camp of higher criticism into utter confusion.</p>
<p>Ramses the Second successfully ended a
period of warfare with the Hittites which
had vexed and distressed Egypt for more
than five hundred years. So great was the
power of the Hittite empire that no previous
conqueror or king in Egypt had been able
to shake off their yoke completely. Indeed,
Ramses the Second succeeded in so doing
only by contracting an important political
marriage with a Hittite princess.</p>
<p>The center of the Hittite empire was
Charchemish. On the site of Megiddo, which
was so often the scene of battles in successive
years, the forces of Ramses fought with the
armed forces of the Hittites. There the Egyptian
monarch successfully defeated the Hittites
in one of the most stirring battles preserved
to us in ancient records. The Hittites
at this time were governed by a number of
kings who had a close confederation in all
affairs pertaining to the empire. In the day
of Ramses the confederation was headed by
the king of Kadesh. According to Ramses&rsquo;
record, which is preserved for us on the walls
of Karnak, all &ldquo;the kings and peoples from
the water of Egypt to the river-land of Mesopotamia
obeyed this chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This army of the confederation massed itself
on the bloody field of Megiddo in a battle
which lasted six hours. Ramses tells in detail
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
how he marched and maneuvered his
forces to gain strategic advantages.</p>
<p>It was a coincidence that the battle began
on the morning of the twenty-fifth anniversary
of the ascension of Ramses the Second.
He celebrated the anniversary of his crowning
by throwing off the yoke of the Hittites.
A complete victory was denied Ramses, due
to the fact that when the Hittite force broke
and fled before him, his army failed to take
advantage of the rout. Falling upon the rich
plunder, they fought among themselves over
the spoils so long that the Hittites were able
to enter their fortified city and barricade
it against the Egyptians. An element of
humor enters into the final statement. Ramses
recounts that he besieged the city for a
number of days, but since &ldquo;Megiddo had the
might of a thousand cities, the king graciously
pardoned the foreign princes.&rdquo; In the list
of the spoil that the Egyptians gathered from
this battle, there occurred the names of one
hundred nineteen towns and cities which
henceforth paid tribute to Egypt. The next
important item was the capture of nine hundred
twenty-four chariots, including the personal
chariot of the Hittite king which was
plated and armored with gold. (See <a href="#pl20">Plate 20</a>.)</p>
<p>Although Ramses boasted that he had
&ldquo;completely overthrown the might and power
of the Hittites,&rdquo; the future history of this
Pharaoh depicts campaign after campaign
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
lasting until the end of his life. At least nine
campaigns are recorded on the walls of Karnak,
in each of which the Hittites were singularly
exterminated, completely overthrown,
and defeated for all time hereafter. The
only trouble seems to have been that the
Hittites didn&rsquo;t realize how completely they
were defeated, so that they came back again
and again! The nearest to peace that Ramses
ever achieved, in his dealings with this race,
was when upon his marriage with a Hittite
princess, a great treaty was signed. In the
records of his battles, Ramses refers to the
Hittite king as &ldquo;the miserable lord of the despised
Hittites.&rdquo; When he records the treaty
that he made at the time of his marriage, he
refers to the same man as &ldquo;his noble and magnificent
brother, a fellow to sit with the god
of the sun by the side of Ramses himself.&rdquo;
It is evident, then, that some of Ramses&rsquo;
records must be taken with a grain of salt.
We noticed recently, as we were studying
and photographing the battle scene of Megiddo
which is portrayed on the north side of
the great temple at Karnak, that Ramses is
shown as having thrown to the ground all
the Hittites and as having slain their king.
Seven years later, however, the king is still
alive to give his daughter in marriage to
Ramses!</p>
<p>Since the Hittites were at this time the
central power of the ancient world, peace
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
with them meant peace with all the other
enemies of Egypt. Perhaps, for this reason,
Ramses&rsquo; boasting of his great victory might
be pardoned.</p>
<p>This great battle is also immortalized by
a contemporary poet. The papyrus copy of
this poem is now in the possession of the
British Museum. Many stanzas from this
notable work, however, are to be seen in
connection with the magnificent battle pictures
at Karnak. Some of these are also
repeated in the temple at Luxor, as well
as on the great monument at Abydos.</p>
<p>Professor Wright refers to this poem as
&ldquo;the earliest specimen of special war correspondence.&rdquo;
This work is known as the poem
of Pentauer. Pentauer is the name of a
Theban poet who wrote his dramatic ode
two years after the battle between Ramses
the Second and the Hittite horde. The boastful
extravagance of his language becomes a
bit wearisome as he sings the praises of Ramses
and chants of the impossible feats of the
monarch. An example of hyperbole is offered
in this verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;King Pharaoh was young and bold. His
arms were strong, his heart courageous. He
seized his weapons, and a hundred thousand
sunk before his glance. He armed his people
and his chariots. As he marched towards
the land of the Hittites, the whole earth trembled.
His warriors passed by the path of the
desert, and went along the roads of the north.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>The &ldquo;miserable and deceitful king of the
Hittites,&rdquo; however, had prepared an ambush.
When the Hittites sprang their trap with their
king in their midst, Pharaoh called on his
mighty men to follow him. Leaping into his
chariot, he assaulted the numberless horsemen
and the armored footmen of the horde
of the Hittites, and plunged into the midst of
their ablest and bravest warriors. As he
fought his way into the press of these noble
horses, Ramses looked around to see how his
force was getting along. To his surprise
he found that they had not followed him; and
he was hemmed in by two thousand five hundred
chariots which were manned by the
mightiest of the Hittite champions. Deserted
by his entire army, Pharaoh saw that he had
to rely upon his own ability, so &ldquo;shouting
for joy, with the aid of the god Amon, he
hurled darts with his right hand and thrust
with the sword in his left hand!&rdquo; He &ldquo;slew
two thousand five hundred horses which were
dashed to pieces!&rdquo; He &ldquo;laid dead the noble
Hittite knights until their limbs dissolved
with fear and they had no courage to thrust!&rdquo;
He swept them into the river Orontes and
slew as long as it was his pleasure.</p>
<p>It is quite evident that Pentauer relied
largely upon his imagination for the details
of this great battle. However exaggerated this
poem may be, nevertheless it has some historical
value. Especially is this so since the
poem of Pentauer and the Karnak record of
Ramses the Second are in virtual agreement
as to the essential details of this battle.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Incidentally, the walls of Karnak yielded
from the records of other kings the historic
evidence of an actual Hittite empire. Tuthmosis
the Third immortalized the Hittites
on the walls of Karnak when he gave a list
of towns in the land of the Hittites over which
he was victorious. Unquestionably this list
contains the first and oldest authentic account
of ancient cities, which are frequently afterwards
mentioned in the Assyrian records as
well. This record is found in the splendid
temple which is called the &ldquo;Hall of Pillars&rdquo;
and which was erected by this notable pharaoh.
It has been said that in this work the
art of Egypt reached its highest point. Certainly
the walls and pillars are literally covered
with the beautifully engraved pictures
and names of the races and cities which the
pharaoh had conquered.</p>
<p>When the Department of Antiquities was
working upon the wall of a lower section, a
catalog of one hundred nineteen conquered
places came to light. This record showed
that, more than three hundred years before
the Israelites entered the land of Canaan,
the Hittites were established in a powerful
dominion over that lovely land. There are
seven separate records of the contacts of
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
this pharaoh with the people who were the
Hittites.</p>
<p>Ramses the First has also left a record of
the treaty of peace that he made with the
Hittite king Seplal at the end of the war that
he unsuccessfully fought to throw off the
yoke of this people. On the north wall of
the temple at Karnak, he gives the route of
his march and tells of the victories that he
won. He did not, however, delineate his
final capitulation. This conflict resulted in
a treaty of peace which is recorded in this
account.</p>
<p>The successor of Ramses the First was Seti
the First, and in his day the treaty was
broken. According to Seti, it was the Hittites
who offended against the covenant, and
he also engraved on the walls at Karnak an
account of the consequent battle with its
result. To bring just a short line from his
voluminous record, he acknowledges his own
greatness in such an inscription as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Seti has struck down the Asiatics; he has
thrown to the ground the Kheta. He has
slain their princes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Telling them how he concluded a treaty
with the Hittites, to the enhancement of his
own glory, Seti&rsquo;s record concludes with these
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;He returns home in triumph. He has annihilated
the people. He has struck to the
ground the Kheta. He has made an end of
his adversaries. The enmity of all people is
turned into friendship.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With just this brief reference to the voluminous
records to be found in Egyptian archeology,
we would be able to establish the triumph
of the Bible in the realm of historical
accuracy, had we no other sources. The
fact of the matter, however, is that the Assyrian
and Babylonian accounts of the Hittites
are at least as numerous as are the
Egyptian.</p>
<p>It may be noted in passing that, although
filled with consternation at these marvelous
discoveries in Egyptology, the critics were
by no means silenced. It would have been
better for their later reputation had they
graciously accepted their defeat and acknowledged
that they were in error. Instead, they
rushed into vociferous refutation of the newly
discovered Egyptian records. Unfortunately,
their denunciations and renewed
claims were given wide publicity by being
included in the then current edition of the
Encyclopedia Britannica. It is to be regretted
that this great encyclopedia has often
been a tremendous aid to criticism in spreading
its errors and fallacies. This in large
measure is due to the fact that there is a
common reverence for this great work in
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
the mind of the average human. There is
a certain class of readers who hold this notable
reference work in such great reverence
that its authority to them is greater than
that of the Word of God. It must be remembered,
however, that the encyclopedia of each
generation represents only the current
thought of that brief period of human experience.
Anything that is written by man is
subject to later revision or repudiation, as
human knowledge increases. So in this great
compendium of human wisdom it is unfortunate
that much space was given to the
famed critic, the Rev. T. K. Cheyne.</p>
<p>This eminent authority was a Fellow of
Balliol College, Oxford. In the above cited
article, he treated the statements of the Bible
as unhistorical and classified them as pure
folklore. Concerning the Biblical references
to the Hittites, he used these exact words,
&ldquo;They cannot be taken as of equal authority
with the Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions!&rdquo;
In dealing with Abraham&rsquo;s purchase
of the burial plot for Sarah, he had a great
deal to say in refutation of the possibility of
any accuracy in the record. At the conclusion
of his criticism he stated, &ldquo;How meager
the tradition respecting the Hittites was in
the time of the great Elohistic narrator, is
shown by the picture of Hittite life in this
reference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Cheyne fell into the great error of
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
claiming that the Hittites were only warriors.
Because they are thus shown on the walls
of Karnak, he concluded that they were mercenary
troops who never entered into business
transactions. In his article on the Canaanites
in this above cited encyclopedia, he
goes so far as to say, &ldquo;The Hittites seem to
have been included among the Canaanites by
mistake. Historical evidence proves convincingly
that they dwelt beyond the borders
of Canaan.&rdquo; These conclusions were also
advocated by his great colleague and collaborator,
Prof. W. H. Newman.</p>
<p>Dr. Newman was also a Fellow of Balliol
College at Oxford and is the author of the
once famous &ldquo;History of the Hebrew Monarchy.&rdquo;
In all of this work he maintained
that the Hittite references in the Old Testament
were unqualifiedly unhistorical. They
prove beyond question, according to the
author, that the writers of the Old Testament
were totally unacquainted with the
times of which they wrote. His conclusion
was that the Old Testament was written
many centuries after the events which it
purports to depict. He stated with finality,
along with Dr. Cheyne, that the Hittite people
were limited to Syria and had no place
in Palestine. Thus the story of Abraham
buying territory from them at Hebron is unquestionably
mythological.</p>
<p>These ardent advocates of a collapsing
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
theory should have waited! It was not long
after these utterances were printed that Prof.
Sayce deciphered certain of the Assyrian
records of Tiglath-pileser. These showed
that in the reign of this monarch, as late as
1130 B. C., <i>the Hittites were still in command
of all the territory from the Euphrates to Lebanon</i>!</p>
<p>Again the Word of God was vindicated,
when the monuments, as they were deciphered,
yielded the interesting information
that the Hittites were notable colonizers.
They also covered all the ancient world as
merchants, and their caravans and trade-routes
were the earliest to be established. They are
in Assyrian annals depicted as artisans and
artists. Although all of them could fight
when war was inevitable, they had a standing
army for the casual and necessary protection
of the realm. Dr. Newman was unfortunate
also in choosing the time in which he charged
the Bible with error. At a most unfortunate
period for criticism in the history of archeology
he questioned the details of Hittite
prowess in the incidental references of the
Scripture. As though the scientists of that day
were in league with the Lord, they laid bare
in site after site a refutation of all the critics
maintained!</p>
<p>It will be remembered that in connection
with the siege of Samaria, as the story is
given in II Kings, the seventh chapter, there
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
is a peculiar but important reference to the
Hittites and their known power. The people
of Israel who were commanded by Jehoram
were distressed by the siege of their capital
when Benhadad of Damascus had pressed
them to the limit of their resistance. Famine
and disease had swept Samaria, so that the
remnant faced the choice of surrendering or
perishing. Elisha had prophesied a deliverance,
and in verses six and seven in the seventh
chapter of II Kings, the fulfillment of
God&rsquo;s promise is given in this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For the Lord had made the host of the
Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise
of horses, even the noise of a great host: and
they said one to another, Lo, the king of
Israel hath hired against us the kings of the
Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to
come upon us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, they arose and fled in the twilight,
and left their tents, and their horses, and
their asses, even the camp as it was, and
fled for their life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Newman found a great deal of
grounds for hilarity in what he called this
&ldquo;childish narrative.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;The unhistorical
tone is too manifest to allow of our
easy belief in it.&rdquo; He admits that there may
have been some unusual deliverance of
Samaria, because of collateral records of
dangerous night panics among various hordes
of antiquity. He adds, however, in reference
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
to the Bible account, &ldquo;The particular ground
of alarm attributed to them does not exhibit
the writer&rsquo;s acquaintance with the times in
a very favorable light. No Hittite kings
can have compared in power with the king
of Judah, the real and near ally, who is not
named at all. Nor is there a single mark
of acquaintance with the facts of contemporaneous
history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two sources of information, however, have
since been derived that flatly refute the
learned Professor and vindicate the accuracy
of the record of God&rsquo;s Word. The Assyrian
sources show conclusively, upon the examination
of their records, that the Hittites at that
time were the greatest power with which
the monarchs of Chaldea had to deal. In
the records of Assur-Nasir-pal a long and
powerful tribute is paid to the military
might of the Hittites. So in that day they
were still a strong and warlike people. They
were especially dreaded by the armies of
antiquity because of the unique distinction
of their chariots. It is to this fact that the
writer of II Kings refers when he speaks of
&ldquo;the noise of chariots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The walls of Karnak give us a clear and
illuminating description of these ancient
weapons of battle. Each chariot was drawn
by two horses, armored and shod with spikes.
Three warriors rode in each chariot. One
of these handled the reins, while the other
two plied arrow, javelin, sword, and dart,
working untold havoc in the closely packed
ranks of ancient infantry. (See <a href="#pl20">Plate 20</a>.)</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>It is also noted that Assur-Nasir-pal has
given a detailed account of the treasures that
he derived from the defeated Hittites. Among
them he lists with great delight &ldquo;swift
chariots with horses therefor.&rdquo; Whenever
this monarch won a victory over the Hittites,
he refers again and again to their
chariots. One such reference is seen in this
statement: &ldquo;The chariots and warlike engines
of the general of Charchemis I laid up in my
magazines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have already noted that Solomon was
engaged in trade with the people called Hittites,
taking chariots and horses in exchange
for his merchandise.</p>
<p>Ramses the Second states that the Hittite
chiefs were distinguished among the nations
&ldquo;for their swift chariots and horses and their
engines of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would seem indeed that the writer of
II Kings was better acquainted with the times
of which he wrote than was the later critic
who disdains the authority of the ancient
scribe!</p>
<p>Shalmaneser made five references to the
Hittites, in every one of which he refers to
their chariots. In the monument of Shalmaneser,
which is now found in the British
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
Museum, the inscription represents the Hittites
at Charchemish with various of their
allies fighting against Shalmaneser. He
concludes this record by saying, &ldquo;With them
I fought; their corpses like chaff through the
country I scattered. Multitudes of chariots
and horses trained to the yoke I seized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sargon also tells of his overthrow of the
Hittite kingdom, and mentions the chariots
that were so formidable an aid to their military
campaigns.</p>
<p>It may be noted in passing that Dr. Cheyne,
like the eminent Dr. Sayce, was later converted
to faith in the integrity of the Word
of God. This might be called one of the later
victories of the Hittite empire. Its people
have risen from the dead to fight for the
faith and for the Book which alike were delivered
unto the saints by the Spirit of God.
Some of the later writings of Dr. Cheyne constitute
a frank repudiation of his earlier position.
His lectures and sermons, after his
discovery of the integrity of the Bible, still
linger in the memory of those who were privileged
to hear them.</p>
<p>The summary of the matter presents a complete
victory for the orthodox school. First,
as to the extent of their empire, the Egyptian
and Israelite inscriptions give three hundred
geographical names in connection with the
domain and rule of the Hittites. These cover
almost every section of the ancient civilized
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
world. These same inscriptions also present
a long list of the allies and the dependencies
which paid tribute to the Hittite kings. Lists
of the satraps who reigned as vassals to the
Hittites have also been recovered.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Hittite inscriptions themselves
have now yielded their secrets to the
earnest student. The earliest note of Hittite
writings comes from a traveler, who in 1812
discovered some incised stones and engraved
mounds which were covered with unknown
hieroglyphics. These finds were made at
Hamath, a small city in Syria. In the light
of the archeological interest of our generation
it seems incredible that these inscriptions
were then ignored completely for threescore
years. Then Dr. William Wright, a Protestant
missionary in Damascus, was enabled, by
the authority he wielded through his friendship
with high government officials, to procure
these stones and to remove them. Some
of these relics had been built into the houses
of Hamath and were part of the walls of
occupied domiciles. One at least was so
heavy that it took eight hours for four oxen
to move it one mile. The romance and adventure
of his indomitable pursuit of these
stones is covered in Dr. Wright&rsquo;s own memoirs
and writings.</p>
<p>At this time, Dr. A. H. Sayce, one of the
greatest archeologists of the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, began the tedious task
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
of deciphering these hieroglyphics. With no
aid, such as the Egyptologists received from
the Rosetta Stone, Dr. Sayce started out on
a cold trail. His ultimate victory constitutes
one of the greatest triumphs of pure reason
in the long record of human endeavor. To
show something of the difficulty that Dr.
Sayce faced, we have portrayed on <a href="#Page_194">page 194</a>
one of these Hittite inscriptions written in the
hieroglyphics of their time. We have also
shown in <a href="#pl21">plate 21</a> the key that was
worked out by Dr. Sayce. Dr. William
Wright, working independently, arrived at
practically the same conclusions.</p>
<p>When these records were publicized as
Hittite inscriptions a storm of protest came
from the critics of the Scripture, who utterly
rejected the findings of both Sayce and
Wright. They attempted to minimize any
historical value that might be derived from
the translation of these inscriptions. Having
built their case against the integrity of the
Bible so strongly upon the error presumed
to be found in the Hittite references, they
could not give up their demonstration without
a struggle.</p>
<p>At this time there came to light a reference
to a silver disk that had previously been
offered to the British Museum. This consisted
of a convex silver plate. It had every
resemblance to the ordinary boss which is
found on the top of the handle of a dagger
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
when such instruments are decorated. This
boss, or plate, had in its center a picture of
a warrior standing upright. He was dressed
in the typical garb of a Hittite soldier. Around
this warrior were two rows of hieroglyphics,
one on either side. These hieroglyphics were
enclosed in a circle. Outside the circle was
an inscription in the cuneiform script. When
this boss was offered to the British Museum,
they kept it a while for study and rejected it
on the grounds that it was probably spurious.
Fortunately, however, they had made an electrotype
copy of this article.</p>
<p>When the conclusions of Sayce and Wright
were rejected by the critics, Dr. Sayce heard
of this exhibit. Thinking that it might be
a way to the Hittite inscriptions, he prosecuted
his search for the original. It had disappeared,
but he fortunately recovered the
copy that was in the British Museum. This
copy then became paramount evidence. At
a glance, Dr. Sayce identified the hieroglyphics
as being Hittite in origin. Using
the key that he had worked out for the
translation of the hieroglyphics, he translated
the boss to be the possession of one Tarkondemos.
Having read this in the Hittite hieroglyphics,
he then translated the cuneiform
text and found the two to be identical.</p>
<p>This vindication of the accuracy of this
earlier work won the confidence of the scholarly
world in the Hittite inscriptions. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
was the deciding voice. The Hittites became
<i>historical</i> to the modern scholar from the records
of Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon. They
become <i>real</i> to us from their own inscriptions.</p>
<p>Nowhere in all the records of human research
and endeavour is it possible to find
a greater and more complete assembling of
the vindication of the integrity of the Word
of God. Even though the hand of the Almighty
must shake the very foundations of
ancient history, He has sworn that His Word
shall be maintained. Thus He has called
from the limbo of forgotten races an entire
nation in an archeological resurrection, that
they, though dead, may tell their tale of the
credibility of the Word of God.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />The Resurrection of Edom</h2>
<p>From the staggering mass of archeological
material and evidence which is at the disposal
of the twentieth century scholar, it is
very difficult to choose the most perfect illustrations
of our theme. If the case of the
Hittites offers a complete refutation of the
critical theories concerning the origin and
veracity of the Old Testament, the resurrection
of Edom is no less dramatic and valuable.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;Edom,&rdquo; together with its various
derivates such as &ldquo;Edomite,&rdquo; occurs
more than fourscore times in the text of the
Old Testament. As the history of this region
and its various inhabitants unfolds in the Old
Testament story, there is a complete, remarkable
and stirring record of this land and its
people that covers many centuries of time.
The word Edom first occurs in the twenty-fifth
chapter of Genesis, thirtieth verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray
thee, with that same red pottage; for I am
faint: therefore was his name called Edom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this first instance the word appears in
connection with the eldest son of Isaac, whose
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
name was changed from Esau to Edom because
of the strange incident of the sale of
his birthright. The pottage that his younger
brother, Jacob, had cooked was made from
a lentil which gave a red hue that was characteristic
of any food in which this particular
lentil was used. So, because Esau exchanged
his priceless rights of inheritance for a pot of
red mush, his name was thereafter called
Edom.</p>
<p>In the thirty-sixth chapter of Genesis,
verses one, eight, and nineteen, this same definite
statement is carried out:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now these are the generations of <i>Esau, who is Edom</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: <i>Esau is Edom</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;These are the sons of <i>Esau, who is Edom</i>, and these are their dukes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Here we read that the dwelling place of Esau
and his people was in mount Seir, and that
Esau is Edom. Hence the name of Edom
was also applied to the people who descended
from Esau, as well as to the country wherein
they dwelt.</p>
<p>This region of the ancient world was also
known as mount Seir. It was so named because
of the progenitor of the Horites who
originally dwelt in that section. We are told
that this people derived their name from
Hori, who was the son of Seir. This ancient
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
people habitually dwelt in caves. Therefore,
by transition, their name came to mean
cave dwellers, as it was descriptive of their
type of habitation.</p>
<p>If one should journey from Jerusalem to
the center of Edom today, the most convenient
route would lie through the modern
city of Amman, which is at the present writing
the seat of government of Iraq. On the
outskirts of this city, and all through this
region, the limestone caves are today occupied
by families of people. They, with their
folks, their horses and cattle, and all of their
possessions, dwell in these ancestral caves
in contentment as their fathers have always
done before them. These caves are furnished
as our modern homes are equipped, with
rugs, tapestries, and all the treasures that
go to make a human habitation into a home!</p>
<p>To summarize the Old Testament record
of Edom and Edomites, we must begin by
noting that although Esau <i>sold</i> his birthright,
his brother Jacob actually <i>stole</i> the blessing.
We are all familiar with this fascinating
drama of the deception wrought by Jacob at
his mother&rsquo;s insistence, when he impersonated
his brother to deceive his dying father.
This account constitutes one of the implacably
honest records characteristic of the Bible.
No other book known to man is so frank
in the delineation of the weaknesses of its
leading characters, as God can deal honestly
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
with sin and failure, since He knows how to
overrule such, and effect a cure! When Esau
learned that the blessing of his father had
been stolen by his younger brother, he took
a solemn oath that as soon as the days of
mourning for his father were ended, he would
slay Jacob, the deceiver. His vengeance was
frustrated, however, as Isaac and Rebekah
sent Jacob to Padan-aram. Here Jacob met
a shrewd bargainer more ruthless than himself;
and dwelt in Padan-aram for twenty
years, during which he prospered enormously.</p>
<p>On his way home from his long sojourn,
the account tells how he met Esau. Two
chapters of Genesis, namely, the thirty-second
and the thirty-third, are occupied with
this dramatic and human document. Still
burdened by the guilt of his dishonest conduct
in the matter of the blessing, and perhaps
feeling also that he had been less than
honorable in buying the birthright, Jacob
prepared an enticing bribe to soften the
wrath of Esau. Word had been brought to
him that Esau was coming to meet him with
four hundred retainers, and Jacob believed
that the hour of reckoning had come. The
score of years, however, had softened the
wrath of Esau, and he greeted his younger
brother with love and affection. Refusing
to accept any bribe or present at his hand,
he made him welcome to his possession. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
record distinctly states that at that time Esau
was dwelling in Seir.</p>
<p>It is evident that he must have prospered
there, as the genealogical tables in the thirty-sixth
chapter of Genesis list his progeny.
All of his grandsons appear in the record as
dukes. Verses one, eight and nine of this
chapter identify the Edomites as descendants
of Esau. They further identify the land of
their dwelling with the ancient site of Seir.
To clarify this point, we here reproduce these
three verses:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Verse twenty begins the list of the previous
inhabitants of Seir, who are called the Horites.
These people are listed in Genesis 14:6
as among the races that were smitten by
Chedorlaomer in the days of Abraham in the
notable Battle of the Kings. It seems evident,
then, that Esau was powerful enough to overcome
the Horites and to impose his dominion
upon them. The two companies intermarried
and became the Edomites of the later record.</p>
<p>The next important point in their development
is introduced in the twentieth chapter
of Numbers. As the children of Israel were
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
making their notable journey from Egypt to
the land of Canaan, Moses sent a courteous
request to the king of Edom asking permission
to make a peaceful passage across that
land. The salutation of Moses was brotherly
and affectionate. He reminded the king of
Edom that Israel and the Edomites were
brethren. He asserted his peaceful purpose,
and gave a pledge not to harm the fields or
the crops with the passage of his flocks.</p>
<p>The king of Edom summarily refused this
courteous request in the most graceless manner.
He threatened the company of Israel
and forbade them to pass over his domain.
The answer of Moses was a renewal of the
request for peaceful passage. This time,
Moses stated that they would stay to the
high and rocky way where no harm could
come to the land from their herds. He even
covenanted to pay for such water as the
flocks might drink. The result was a renewal
of the threat to oppose the passage
with the edge of the sword. Consequently
the people of Israel were forced to make a
circuit of Edom, and they passed around its
border by way of mount Hor.</p>
<p>From this time on, there was implacable
enmity between the two great branches of
these Semitic people. The subsequent history
is a constant record of battle and hatred
on both sides.</p>
<p>Saul fought against them in the days of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
might, and records with delight his various
successes against them.</p>
<p>When David occupied the throne warfare
was renewed. So great a nuisance did the
Edomites prove to the people of Israel in
David&rsquo;s day, that this great warrior king
finally directed a complete campaign against
them. In the notable battle that was fought
in the salt valley, he slew eighteen thousand
of the Edomite army and pressed on to capture
their cities. In their conquered strongholds,
he placed capable garrisons. Under
Joab these garrisons patrolled the land for
more than six months. At this time Benhadad,
to whom we shall again refer, escaped
to Egypt to become a later source of distress
to Israel.</p>
<p>In all of their history, the Edomites were
consistently allied against Israel. They
never missed a chance to vex their kinsmen.
No matter who the enemy of Israel might be,
the Edomites hastened to form an alliance
with that foe and gladly accepted the occasion
to battle against Israel. This bad blood
that existed between these races, who should
have been allied by the ties of consanguinity,
resulted in the prophecies that foretold the
final overthrow of Edom and the destruction
of the people. Such a prophecy is written
in Jeremiah 49, verses seventeen and twenty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one
that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
hiss at all the plagues thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore hear the counsel of the Lord, that
he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes
that he hath taken against Edom; and his
purposes that he hath purposed against the
inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of
the flock shall draw them out; surely he shall
make their habitations desolate with them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Nebuchadnezzar finally took the
people of Israel away into their great captivity,
the Edomites rejoiced without restraint.
Their happiness was utterly unbounded
and they celebrated with every
means at their disposal. They overran the
southern regions of Judah and took much
of that land for themselves during the days
of the captivity.</p>
<p>Jeremiah, in the Book of Lamentations,
reproves their unnatural jubilation and
warns Edom that the same fate that overtook
Israel will come upon them.</p>
<p>So also the prophet Ezekiel speaks from
his refuge and warns Edom. In the twenty-fifth
chapter of Ezekiel, we read in verses
twelve to fourteen, this following warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord God; Because that Edom
hath dealt against the house of Judah by
taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended,
and revenged himself upon them;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore thus saith the Lord God; I will
also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and
will cut off man and beast from it; and I will
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
make it desolate from Teman; and they of
Dedan shall fall by the sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by
the hand of my people Israel: and they shall
do in Edom according to mine anger and according
to my fury; and they shall know my
vengeance, saith the Lord God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joel adds his voice in a characteristic reference
such as we find in the third chapter
and nineteenth verse of his prophecy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall
be a desolate wilderness, for the violence
against the children of Judah, because they
have shed innocent blood in their land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So also Amos, in chapter one and verse
eleven utters this fateful sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord: For three transgressions
of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away
the punishment thereof; because he did pursue
his brother with the sword, and did cast
off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually,
and he kept his wrath forever.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the prophet is moved of God to list
the continued transgressions of Edom, and
the consequent and subsequent judgment.</p>
<p>So literally were these words of the prophets
fulfilled that Edom was not only overthrown
and its people vanquished, but for a
great deal more than a thousand years the
very name of their city and people dropped
out of the memory of men. Here is one
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
more case where a great people catastrophically
disappeared from the stage of history,
leaving no secular record of the part that
they had played in the drama of human life.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this was the critics&rsquo; <i>great</i>
occasion! With a vociferous unanimity they
argued and wrote that there had been no
city called Edom, and no people called Edomites.
Since the word &ldquo;Edom&rdquo; literally means
&ldquo;red,&rdquo; the critics erected a fanciful demonstration
purporting to show that the Edomites
would be any people with a red complexion.
According to their fanciful theory,
any race or group of people whose skin or
hair was red would be poetically called
Edomites.</p>
<p>When the defenders of the text pointed to
the denunciations in the prophets, the critics
laughed them out of the picture. These utterances
were listed as pure, poetic fancy and
figurative diatribes. The critics pointed out
that all such outbursts were found <i>in the
prophecies</i>! As a stated principle of higher
criticism, all prophecies are repudiated. They
are held to be purely fanciful, and any fulfillment
is entirely coincidental. This attitude
is the proper one for criticism to assume.
The supernatural fulfillment of prophecy is
one of the strongest evidences of the Divine
origin of the Scriptures. Such demonstrations
cannot be reconciled with the critical
basis of humanism. Therefore, it is only logical
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
that it be ignored or denied in a critical
approach to the text.</p>
<p>The enemies of orthodoxy had one strong
argument that in the early day seemed to
be unanswerable. Their constant cry was
&ldquo;Where is Edom?&rdquo; Admittedly, this was a
question that the orthodox believer could not
answer. The city had disappeared, the people
were forgotten, and no relic nor remnant
of this race remained. It was not until the
nineteenth century of the Christian era that
the resurrection of Edom began.</p>
<p>The first and earliest archeological reference
to Edom which was discovered, was a
statement from the record of Ramses the
Third, who proudly boasted that in his great
campaign he smote the people of Seir. The
next discovery came when the record of Tiglath-pileser
was read. In his story he told
of the campaign against Rezin, king of Syria.
He recounted that among other vassals who
yielded to his yoke, he received homage from
Quaus-Malaka of Edom. This Rezin, with
whom we shall later deal in Tiglath-pileser&rsquo;s
voluminous records, is the king of Syria who
is warned in the seventh chapter of Isaiah as
allied with Israel against Judah.</p>
<p>Following this, we have the monument of
Esar-haddon. He also tells how among his
Assyrian conquests he overthrew the Edomites
and forced their king to render homage
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
and allegiance to his power. Again, the records
of Nebuchadnezzar tell us that in his
final battle with Judah, the Edomites were
among his allied forces.</p>
<p>Gradually, as this people began to rise
from the silence and obscurity of forgotten
antiquity, something of their customs and
beliefs began to be recovered. At least three
of their deities are known today. These are
Hadad, Quaus and Koz&eacute;. About 300 B. C.,
Edom fell into the hands of a people who
were called the Nabataeans. Their inscription
claims that they captured Edom, exterminated
its then numerous population and
occupied its capital, <i>which was Petra</i>.</p>
<p>Here, then, is the final vindication of the
text of Scripture. This city, Petra, is variously
mentioned in the Old Testament text
as the center of Edomite dominion. It is
sometimes called &ldquo;Sela&rdquo; in the historical and
prophetical references, and twice is referred
to by the name of &ldquo;Rock.&rdquo; Obadiah calls
the city &ldquo;the rock,&rdquo; the Greek form of which
would be &ldquo;<i>he Petra</i>.&rdquo; It is thus evident that
it was known peculiarly for its structure.
This fact appeared to be of no significance
until archeology had brought it to the prominence
of our present comprehension. The
issue of the National Geographic Magazine
for May, 1907, made Petra so well known
to the English speaking world that there remains
little to be said of an historical nature
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
to establish the actuality and certainty of
this great discovery.</p>
<p>With the collapse of the Roman empire,
Petra disappeared from the knowledge of
mankind and became shrouded in mystery
and darkness. It began to emerge into the
light again when a young Swiss traveler first
visited its site in 1812. The record of his
discovery was not published, however, until
ten years later.</p>
<p>The next notice of the site of Petra was
taken when two British naval officers visited
the splendid remains in 1818, and published
their observations seven years later. After
this it became the custom for adventurous
travelers to take a brief look at the stupendous
beauty of this forgotten city and make
some passing mention. The real exploration
of Petra, however, began some thirty years
ago when certain German scholars made a
scientific investigation of the site. The results
of their labors were printed only in
German, and filled a surprising number of
lengthy volumes. A large literature on Petra
is now in the possession of the English speaking
world, but surprisingly little of a definite
nature is known about its earlier inhabitants.</p>
<p>The monuments of Petra, which we here
illustrate in plates numbered <a href="#pl22">Plate 22</a> and <a href="#pl23">Plate 23</a>,
were not built by the later inhabitants, who
were called Nabataeans. These monumental
structures were carved out of the living rock.
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
Some of them were temples, and others were
tombs. To illustrate the extent of these
works, we may note that the great open-air
theatre at Petra would comfortably seat a
crowd of three thousand spectators.</p>
<p>Just a word of explanation is necessary
before we proceed to the application of this
discovery. Petra, the capital of Edom and
the principal city of the Edomites, is found
in the most rugged region of that part of
the earth. The land is thrown up into abrupt
ranges, which are deeply incised with canyons
and gorges until they form one of the
wildest and most entrancing geographical
spectacles to be seen in the Eastern world.
In some regions the underlying structure is
limestone. The walls of the canyon, however,
are largely porphyry and sandstone.
The sandstone is brilliantly colored with hues
which run from brown through red, to a
definite purple. Some of the strata, grotesquely
twisted and torn and laid bare by
erosion, are among the loveliest and most
entrancing geological studies in that region.</p>
<p>In approaching the site of Petra, it is necessary
to journey up a narrow canyon called
in the Arabic, a siq. This approach is so
narrow that almost all of the way it is
scarcely possible for two horsemen to ride
abreast. This might have been an important
factor in deciding the site of the city in antiquity.
A dozen men could have successfully
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
defended the approaches to Petra
against an entire army of invaders.</p>
<p><a href="#pl24">Plate 24</a> will give some conception
of the ruggedness of the country and
the difficulty of approach. In place of a
truck, such as would have been used in flat
country, we have the familiar donkey carrying
the camera and supplies. This resting
place is in one of the wider sections of the
canyon. <a href="#pl25">Plate 25</a> is the first
glimpse of one of the amazing monuments of
Petra. This great structure bears the Arabic
name of El Khazne. A full view of this
temple is given in <a href="#pl26">plate 26</a>.</p>
<p>Petra was not built after the fashion in
which cities are constructed today. Every
structure was hewn out of the living sandstone.
The city has been called &ldquo;The Rose
Red City, half as old as time,&rdquo; and this description
is perfect. When the sunlight
strikes the ruins of Petra, it is as red as blood.
Edom, indeed, and Edomites, might well be
applied by the ancients to the color and
beauty of this old site, as well as to its inhabitants!
In <a href="#pl27">plate 27</a> we have
illustrated this manner of carving a dwelling
from the living stone in the great structure
which the Arabians call El Deir. (See <a href="#pl28">Plate 28</a>.)
Observing this photograph, you will
note that the rock wall has been hewn away
into the shape of columns, pillars, and decorated
facade in the similitude of a building
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
that has been put together by the orthodox
style of masonry. Such, however, is not the
case. <a href="#pl29">Plate 29</a> shows some of the
detail of one of these notable monuments. It
will be observed that the workers began from
the top and carved their way down. In the
upper left corner of the picture a series of
holes will be seen. These were chiseled for
the foothold of the workers who started the
process.</p>
<p>Their manner of labor was unique. The
architect laid out the size, shape, and site of
the building, and the workmen began to cut
away the stone about the top of their designated
area until they had a recessed trough
some ten feet deep into the face of the cliff,
on the top and both sides. Then, beginning
with the top of the structure, they carved that
slab in the similitude of a building. As they
worked their way down, they shaped the
pillars, carved these brilliant decorations and
recessed the cliff on both sides to make their
monuments stand forth. <a href="#pl28">Plate 28</a>
shows the result of this type of labor, looking
from the bottom upward. Reaching the bottom
of their carved columns, these artisans
would then chisel away between and behind
the posts that they had formed of the face
of the cliff until they had a great square
entry way. The face of this entry way would
be further beautified by carving the semblance
of a doorway. A short tunnel would
then be run back into the cliff to serve as a
hall, and rooms hollowed out on the inside
into a series of apartments or caves. &ldquo;Cave-dwellers,&rdquo;
indeed, is the proper name for
these people!</p>

<p>The extent of their operations may be
dimly understood from plates numbered <a href="#pl22">plate 22</a>
and <a href="#pl23">plate 23</a>. Some of these tombs that are
here depicted, were never finished. A few
of them have suffered from the ravages of
time, but the general state of preservation
of these priceless monuments of Petra is
fascinating. In <a href="#pl30">plate 30</a> we have
depicted the approach to the garden tomb.
By the side of this tomb there is the ascent
to the &ldquo;high place&rdquo; for the sacrifices of their
idolatrous religion. In <a href="#pl31">plate 31</a>
we have shown the altar and the &ldquo;high place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These high places of antiquity should be
the subject for a volume in themselves. They
are mentioned one hundred two times in the
Old Testament. Being the altars of heathen
sacrifices, they were the subject of constant
denunciation on the part of the Lord God and
were a source of trouble and distress to
Israel during all her periods of apostasy. The
<i>groves</i> to which the prophets refer and which
the godly kings cut down, were the places
where Ashtoreth was worshipped. Very few
systems of degenerate religion in antiquity
were more lecherous and vile than the cult
of this unclean goddess. The high places,
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
however, were the altars where sacrifice was
made to the gods of the heathen nations. As
these sacrifices were very often human, and
as it was not uncommon for the ancients to
dedicate their children to the fierce and
abominable worship of their false religion,
the people of Israel were sternly forbidden
to have any contact with such idolatrous
practices. So when godly kings occupied
the throne, they destroyed the &ldquo;high places.&rdquo;
In a time of apostasy the high places were
builded and dedicated again. Some of the
most stirring denunciations of the prophetic
sections of the Old Testament are in the
words that God directs against the high places
of Israel and in the announcing of His final
and complete victory over them.</p>
<p>This high place shown in <a href="#pl31">plate 31</a>
is characteristic, then, of the ancient
custom. It shows that the Hittites had forsaken
whatever knowledge they may have
derived from their earlier Hebrew origin and
were wholly dedicated to the practices of
idolatry. Incidentally, the worship of God
is still practiced by Israel, but the &ldquo;high
places&rdquo; of Edom and all other heathen centers
are merely curiosities today!</p>
<p>As far as artistry and ability are concerned,
antiquity knew no greater or more
capable people. The monument that they
have left to mark their mysterious disappearance
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
is a lasting testimony to their culture
and power.</p>
<p>But more than that, it is a living, resurrected
testimony to the truth and credibility
of the Word of God!</p>
<p>There is no scene of desolation and ruin
that amazes the spirit of man as much as
the desolation of Edom. Forsaken of human
occupants, the wonderful Rose Red City is
today a curiosity to be viewed by the hardy
adventurer who would study the antiquities
of the Eastern world.</p>
<p>Just what hands constructed these noble
temples and tombs it is not at this time possible
to say. The Nabataeans were incapable
of producing this kind of work, nor would
they have invested the time. The bodies
of the departed were spread upon the field
as fertilizer or buried in the most indescribably
filthy pits of their day and time. The
Semitic peoples who preceded them, however,
have left this record in stone as a testimony
to their reverence for the dead. What
the future will yield in the hoped-for excavations
of Petra, no one is able to say. If,
however, a spade is never sunk into soil and
no more appears to the gaze of man than is
seen by the casual traveler today, we have
sufficient to call forth a doxology from the
hearts of those who love and reverence the
Word of God. We cannot refrain from commenting
again and again upon the marvelous
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
manner in which the Author of this Great
Book has cared for His own case.</p>
<p>The consternation and defeat of the critics
have been complete in this instance. What
a quaint conceit it is in our generation to
note that God is so firm in His promised defense
of His Book, that He will move to crush
the enemies of the Word even if it is necessary
to smite their fallacious fancy with a
carved mountain of stone!</p>

<br />The Brazen Shields of Rehoboam</h2>
<p>In the logical presentation of this subject,
we now come to that period of history in
which the pharaohs, who are named by name
in the Scriptures and are thus identified
beyond question, make their contribution to
the evidence which sustains the record of
the Bible.</p>
<p>Laying aside controversial discussions as
to the identity of the various pharaohs who
preceded, we note that the first of Egypt&rsquo;s
many monarchs to appear under his personal
name in the Word of God is Shishak the 1st.
His name appears on the monuments of Egypt
as Shashanq the 1st, but his own records
identify him as the &ldquo;Shishak&rdquo; of I Kings 14,
and II Chronicles 12. The outstanding accomplishments
of his entire reign seem to
have been the invasion of Palestine and the
capture of Jerusalem. In the account which
this monarch left in the priceless writings
at Karnak, the most noteworthy is the story
told on the second pylon of the main temple,
where the conqueror has given a list of all
the towns and villages which he overthrew
in Palestine. To this he added a record of
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
the gold and silver ornaments that he carried
away from Jerusalem. He specifically
noted the bucklers and shields of Solomon
and also the golden quivers which Solomon&rsquo;s
father had captured from the king of Zobah.</p>
<p>Once again we listen to some collateral
gossip from far antiquity to see the background
of this strange invasion of Jerusalem.
Weaving together records of forgotten campaigns,
homely events of family affairs, the
conduct of pragmatic generations, the history
preserved in the books of the Old Testament,
together with the voices of monuments and
ruins, we gradually achieve a basis of understanding.
The Pharaoh Siamen, whose capital
was at Zoan, appears to have been an
ally of Edom. In the days when secular
historical records begin to coincide with the
record of the text, Edom was ruled by a regent.
King Hadad was a lad of tender years,
and though he nominally was vested with
the crown, his able and powerful mother
ruled in his name. The queen regent, incidentally,
was an aunt of Solomon. Holding
that thought in temporary abeyance,
we will continue to investigate this quaint
family alliance. David and Jonathan made a
successful assault upon Edom, which resulted
in the capture of the city. Such rights and
powers as a conquering monarch has always
abrogated to himself, then devolved upon
David in respect to Edom. When it became
apparent that the city would fall, the queen
regent took her young son and fled to Egypt
for safety. In view of the fact that Edom
and Egypt were at that time allies, the royal
party was well received and, with the prodigal
hospitality of that day, became guests at
the court for the balance of their lives.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>In the course of the passing years, Siamen
was gathered to his fathers, and Psabekhanu
the 2nd reigned in his stead. The wise mother
of Hadad, knowing that alliances do not always
outlast the persons who made them
and, desiring to protect Hadad&rsquo;s interests in
the country that they had lost by force of
arms, entered into a typical and common intrigue.
She brought about the marriage of
her son, Hadad, with a sister of Psabekhanu.
Thus, Hadad became the brother-in-law of
the reigning monarch of Egypt and, presumably,
strengthened the ties that bound the
Egyptian power to the interests of his small
country.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Solomon, who had succeeded
his father, moved to protect his inherited
claim on Edom. This he did by
marrying the daughter of Psabekhanu. It is
presumed that the relationship of a son-in-law
might be a stronger claim for alliance
than that of a brother-in-law. Some short
while later the second daughter of Psabekhanu
married the Prince Shishak. Thus Solomon
and the heir-apparent of the throne
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
of Egypt, Shishak, became brothers-in-law.
By marriage, however, the queen of Edom
was their aunt. At a glance the student can
see that affairs were a bit messy, to say the
very least. Hadad maintained his rights to
Edom and conducted at the Egyptian court
an intrigue for his restoration. The desires
of Pharaoh were divided between his natural
wish to keep the peace and his interest in
the importunities of his brother-in-law, as
weighed against the desires of his son-in-law.
Through this tangled scheme of alliances it
came about that Solomon&rsquo;s son would have
some legal rights of succession in Egypt. But
Shishak&rsquo;s son would have the same claim
to succession in Palestine. Solomon, being
much older than Shishak, died first. The
story which now follows is recorded in the
Word of God, and on the pillars of antiquity,
for, shortly after the death of Solomon, Shishak
invaded Judah.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;why&rdquo; of the matter is easily understood.
The first reason was loot. The brief
account that is given in I Kings 14:25-28 is
here appended to introduce our consideration
of this event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass in the fifth year of king
Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came
up against Jerusalem: And he took away
the treasures of the house of the Lord, and
the treasures of the king&rsquo;s house; he even
took away all: and he took away all the shields
of gold which Solomon had made.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;And King Rehoboam made in their stead
brazen shields, and committed them unto the
hands of the chief of the guard, which kept
the door of the king&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was so, when the king went into the
house of the Lord, that the guard bare them,
and brought them back into the guard chamber.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that record it is noted that among the
treasures of the house of the Lord which
Shishak carried away, were the shields of
gold which Solomon had made. For a description
of these shields and some conception
of their value, we turn to the tenth chapter
of I Kings, verses fourteen to seventeen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon
in one year was six hundred threescore
and six talents of gold,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides that he had of the merchantmen,
and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and
of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors
of the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And king Solomon made two hundred targets
of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of
gold went to one target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he made three hundred shields of beaten
gold; three pounds of gold went to one
shield: and the king put them in the house
of the forest of Lebanon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wealth of Solomon has never been
adequately computed. It is stated that from
the tomb of Tutanhkamen, in the most
famous excavation of our generation, treasure
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
to the value of $14,000,000 was recovered.
The splendor and wealth of that pharaoh
were insignificant compared to that of Solomon,
the Magnificent. We see, for instance,
in this fourteenth verse that Solomon&rsquo;s income
in gold bullion alone was almost the
exact equivalent of $20,000,000 in our day
and time. We must understand, however,
that there was a vast difference between the
values of the money standards of that time
and of our own. The ratio would be about
15 to 1. For instance, a silver shekel would
buy a cow; a half-shekel would buy an ass.
If we evaluate their currency by purchasing
power, it would take fifteen of our dollars
to equal one of theirs. So the sum of gold,
which is the equivalent of $20,000,000 by
our former gold standard measurement, gives
a conception of the annual income of Solomon,
only if it is transmuted to our present ratio of
purchasing power. This figure does not include
all the tariff and income from taxes,
the profit on his merchandising and the tribute
in gifts of vassal nations. He was in the
fortunate circumstance of paying income tax
to himself so that his income remained undiminished!
The gold of Solomon was
hoarded for a unique and peculiar purpose.</p>
<p>When David desired to build a house for
the worship of God, his offer was rejected
on the ground that he was a man of blood.
However, the Lord said that his son should
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
build the house of prayer, and David began
the hoarding of gold for the erection and
beautification of that temple. The estimates
of the amount of gold that went into that
temple go as high as two and one-half billions
of dollars. It is not too much to say
that no building ever erected by the hands
of man could excel the beauty, the artistic
perfection, the splendor, and the intrinsic
value of the temple that Solomon built.</p>
<p>In the Scriptural citation in I Kings, we
have just read of the two hundred targets or
bucklers of beaten gold. Also, there are
catalogued the three hundred shields of
beaten gold; three pounds of gold went into
the construction of each shield. At the present
rate of gold values, that would mean that
each of these shields was worth $1680.00.
There was considerably over a half million
dollars of pure gold hammered into those
shields. This glittering and entrancing
treasure intrigued the greed of every conqueror
of antiquity, but no man was able to
take it from the House of God while His protection
and care were upon it. It is not to
be wondered that Shishak considered the
capture of that treasure as the highest
achievement of his reign.</p>
<p>The second reason for Shishak&rsquo;s invasion,
however, was mainly political. After the
death of Solomon, the kingdom was divided.
Rehoboam, possessing the Southern kingdom,
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
was a weakling who was, moreover, under
the influence of vicious, untrustworthy counselors.
Perhaps his tendency towards idolatry
may be traced to his mother who was
an Ammonite and whose influence, undoubtedly,
turned him away from monotheism.
At any rate, Bel, Ashtoreth, Moloch and Baal
were worshipped throughout the land on
every high hill and under many green trees.
The most unclean practices were indulged
in by the people until the judgment of God
necessarily descended upon them. Shishak&rsquo;s
chief concern was not over the idolatry of
the people, however, but over the effect of
their dereliction upon the development of
the kingdom. In order to protect his possible
rights of succession in Palestine, he moved to
make Rehoboam a vassal, and brought him
under the yoke of bondage, making him a
governor for Egypt.</p>
<p>A more comprehensive account of this invasion
is given in the twelfth chapter of
II Chronicles. A great many people have
raised the question as to why we have the
duplication of the record in the books of
Kings and Chronicles in the Scripture. It
has been argued that the same stories told
again in Chronicles are a senseless and useless
repetition of the record already written
in Kings. This specific instance is perhaps
as fine an answer to that objection as can be
found. It might be said that the Books of
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
Kings recount the <i>deeds</i> of men and the Books
of Chronicles deal largely with their <i>motives</i>.
The Books of the Kings record history as
enacted by man, while the records of Chronicles
give God&rsquo;s side of the story and tell the
&ldquo;why&rdquo; of things that would otherwise be
mysterious.</p>
<p>For instance, the twelfth chapter of II
Chronicles begins, &ldquo;And it came to pass when
Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and
had strengthened himself, he forsook the law
of the Lord, and all Israel with him.&rdquo; Here
is a bleak, unvarnished record of apostasy.
The price of a man in his own position and
standing has led him to debauch a nation
spiritually and morally. Therefore, the second
verse follows as a natural consequence:
&ldquo;And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of
king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came
up against Jerusalem, <i>because they had transgressed
against the Lord</i>.&rdquo; Here is an illuminating
comment upon the motives and principles
that underlie this record. It is a foreshadowing
of the first chapter of Romans.
When men give up God and deny Him a place
in their culture and practices, it is inevitable
that God will give them up to the consequences
of their vile conduct. In this case
it was Shishak who brought judgment upon
Jerusalem. His twelve hundred chariots and
sixty thousand cavalrymen were supported
by so many infantry that the number was
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
never totaled. They are called &ldquo;innumerable,&rdquo;
which is a simple way of saying that
the number was too vast to take time counting
them.</p>
<p>We are then told that when Shishak had
captured all the outlying cities of Judah and
was on his way to Jerusalem, the prophet
Shemaiah frankly told King Rehoboam that
his trouble had come upon him because of
his apostasy. In blunt words he delivered
this graphic warning: &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord,
Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I
also left you in the hand of Shishak.&rdquo; When
this message was so courageously delivered,
the princes of Israel and the godless counselors
of the apostate king together prostrated
themselves before the Lord and acknowledged
that His judgment was just and His decision
was righteous. The record continues
with the fact that when the Lord saw that
they had repented, He promised to save the
humbled court and the threatened city. But
with the promise of deliverance from destruction
there came also the grim edict that
in order that they might learn the difference
between serving God and being under the
bondage of a heathen culture, they should
be subject to Shishak and serve him.</p>
<p>Thus in Chronicles we do have the account
repeated that was given to us in the record
of the Kings, but with additional details that
illumine and clarify the record. Shishak
swept the land bare of precious metals and
took away the treasures of the temple as well.
Not only did he leave the king and the court
destitute of their priceless ornaments, but
he carried away also the shields of gold which
Solomon had made.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>We now enter into a consideration of one
of the most tragic and humiliating spectacles
in all antiquity. When the penitent and restored
king saw the effects of his apostasy,
he called the people back to the practice of
their earlier faith and himself came daily to
the house of the Lord for the exercise of
prayer. But as the humbled monarch knelt
in prayer, he could not keep his eyes off the
vacant walls. Where the five hundred golden
objects had once hung, testifying to the
wealth of that house and the greatness of his
father, there was nothing but the bare wall.
It must be remembered that those golden
ornaments had not belonged to him. They
had been hung in their places to praise and
glorify God by his greater ancestor. Therefore,
when an enemy came and stole them
away, it was a constant and mute reproach
to him because of his own failure to live up
to the standards and greatness of a preceding
generation.</p>
<p>The troubled king gave orders that the
targets and shields should be replaced with
copies of what had been lost. There was,
however, neither gold nor silver in the land,
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
for Shishak had made a clean sweep of all
that was valuable. Thus, having lost the
reality of their treasure, the best they could
do was to make a cheap similitude in brass.</p>
<p>Needless to say, brass is a pitiful substitute
for the precious metal which we call gold.
If it is kept in a shining condition, at first
glance brass may have some resemblance
to the nobler metal, but it quickly tarnishes
and its glitter fades. For this reason, the
targets and shields of brass were stored in
the house of the guard. At the hour when
the king came to the temple to pray, the
guard polished these ridiculous substitutes
and hung them in their places so that the king
might delude himself by the glitter and shine,
and thus have some balm for his troubled
spirit. There is, of course, an element of
humour in this tragic record!</p>
<p>The moral lessons are almost innumerable
and would provide a minister with sermon
material for days on end. We are faced with
a somewhat similar situation in Christendom
today. Upon the walls of the House of Faith,
our believing fathers hung the golden shields
that constitute the doctrines of Christianity.
The brilliant glory of those foundational
treasures was never threatened as long as
the church was true to God. But we in our
generation, alas, have allowed an enemy to
come in and rob us of many of those golden
shields.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>We cannot over-emphasize the fact that it
is always an enemy who seeks thus to despoil
the House of our Faith. Though he may come
in the guise of a friend, or even of a relative,
as in the case of Shishak, the man who robs
us of our golden shields is an enemy at heart
and in purpose.</p>
<p>May we illustrate this suggestion by saying,
for instance, that our fathers believed in
the golden fact of the deity of Jesus Christ.
They held as a basic fact of Christianity that
in the person of our Saviour, Almighty God
was incarnated to be the Redeemer of mankind.
Satan, in the person of many of his
charming and well-mannered cohorts, has
stolen that shield from many a temple of
prayer. Men speak now of the &ldquo;divinity&rdquo; of
Jesus instead of the &ldquo;deity.&rdquo; Having established
this premise, they then continue with
the statement that we are <i>all</i> divine and have
this same spark of divinity within our spirits,
to a greater or lesser extent. When the
golden shield of the deity of Christ disappeared
from the walls of many churches that
had once been Christian, the worshippers
made a beautiful substitute with the brazen
replica of Unitarianism. The tarnished brass
of that un-Christian doctrine is a miserable
substitute indeed for the blessed assurance
that is resident in the fact of the deity of
the Saviour.</p>
<p>Our fathers believed also in the virgin
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
birth of the Son of God. They accepted literally
the record that Almighty God himself
had given of the incarnation of His Son.
Our fathers believed that the body of Jesus
was formed in the womb of a virgin woman
because of the direct visitation of the Holy
Ghost. Thus, the birth of Jesus Christ was
a biological miracle, and He owed even His
earth origin to His <i>heavenly</i> Father alone!
This foundational fact of the Christian revelation
has disappeared from the walls and the
worship of many a once-Christian gathering.
In the place of that golden fact there is the
ghastly and brazen substitute of an illegitimate
child, who was probably the fruit of
a woman&rsquo;s sin! And then men wonder that
the old-time power and greatness of the
Christian faith seem lacking in much of our
land today!</p>
<p>In like manner, the golden shield of redemption
through the shed blood of Calvary
has been exchanged for the brazen substitute
of a &ldquo;Perfect Example.&rdquo; The physical resurrection
of Jesus Christ has been bartered for
a misty idea of some sort of a spiritual resurrection
that has no bearing upon the facts
of the record that God has given to man.
Shield by shield, and buckler by buckler, the
things that were given to us for our defense,
gleaming with the intrinsic value of a supernatural
revelation, have been stolen away by
the enemy. The humanistic substitutes that
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">261</span>
have replaced them have left us at the mercy
of the enemy who would destroy our souls.</p>
<p>But great as are the moral lessons involved
in this record, its apologetical value is incalculably
greater. It has been the custom
in our day to question the historical accuracy
of much of the record of the Scripture. So
it is with considerable interest that we turn
back to ancient Egypt to see what can be
learned from the external sources of pure
archeology concerning these sections of the
Old Testament.</p>
<p>The visitor to the British Museum may
come away well acquainted with this man
Shishak. In the fourth Egyptian Room, in
Table Case &ldquo;O&rdquo;, there is a pair of gold bracelets,
the exhibits being numbered 134 and
135. These beautiful ornaments are overlaid
with lapis lazuli, and a blue substance
which is similar to faience. The inside of
each is inscribed with a text written in
hieroglyphics stating that the bracelets were
&ldquo;Made for the Princess,&rdquo; the daughter of
the chief of all the bowmen, Nemareth,
whose mother was the daughter of the Prince
of the land of Reshnes. This Nemareth was
the descendant in the fifth generation of
Buiu-auau, a Libyan prince who was the father
of Shishak the First.</p>
<p>In this same case, exhibit number 217 is a
heavy gold ring set with a scarab carved
from soapstone, which is inscribed with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
clearly cut cartouche containing both the
prenomen and nomen of Shishak the First.</p>
<p>Looking further in this case, exhibit number
392 is a silver ring inscribed with the
titles of an official who held many important
positions under two monarchs. He was president
of the granaries, also a prophet of the
fourth order, served as a scribe and at one
time was libationer in the reigns of Psammetichus
and Shishak.</p>
<p>The most important of all the records of
Shishak, of course, is the voluminous account
that he caused to be engraved at the Temple
of Karnak. A detail is added in Shishak&rsquo;s
record that is not contained in the Scriptures.
According to the conqueror, to strengthen the
ties of vassalage, he gave Jeroboam one of
his daughters in marriage. This complete
record of Shishak&rsquo;s we photographed, studied
carefully, and found eminently satisfactory,
with the single exception that the king of
Judah is not named by name in Shishak&rsquo;s
account of this conquest. But he does tell
of the capture of Judah, the rape of Jerusalem,
and gives a categorical list of cities and
villages overthrown. He specifically mentions
the bucklers and shields of gold that he
took from the temple.</p>
<p>In a word, this science of archeology, upon
the authority of men long dead, but who have
since been raised to testify, stamps an emphatic
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
O. K. upon this section of the Sacred
Record.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The next king who parades these pages
under the designation of his proper name is
the Pharaoh Zera, who has also been identified
with Osarkon. Shishak&rsquo;s first-born son,
named both Usarkon and Osarkon the First,
succeeded his father to the throne as the last
of the Tanite kings of the twenty-first dynasty.
This son, in turn, was called Shishak
and became the high priest of Amon.
Osarkon the First was succeeded by Takeloth
the First, who, in turn, was followed by
Osarkon the Second. Since both of these
Osarkons figure in the Scriptural account,
we briefly cover their record as it occurs
in antiquity.</p>
<p>Being emperor of Ethiopia, as well as of
Egypt, the first Osarkon, or Zera, had a vast
horde of Ethiopian allies who fought with
him in his important conquests. This entire
line was of Libyan extraction. A portion of
Africa that is now temporarily possessed by
the crown of Italy seems to have given rise
to this family of conquering rulers. Undoubtedly
the designation &ldquo;Ethiopian&rdquo; was
suggested by this African ancestry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>The Scriptural account of this man&rsquo;s ill-starred
military expedition is given in the
fourteenth chapter of II Chronicles. When
King Abijah died, his son Asa succeeded to
the throne. The ascension of Asa was followed
by ten years of such peace and prosperity
as was almost unprecedented in those
troublous times. The reason given is that
Asa was a godly man and found favour in
the sight of the Lord. He shattered the
images erected to unclean idols, cut down
the groves where Ashtoreth was worshipped,
demolished the altars and the high places,
and purged the land of its apostasy. He
compelled the people of Judah to return to
the true faith and to obey the Lord and His
commandments. He strengthened the fortified
centers and in a masterly fashion built
up his reserves.</p>
<p>The ten years of prosperity and industry
found the land of Judah in an enviable condition
that left it well worth robbing! Since
the opportunity to steal and loot was the
only incentive required by the grim pragmatists
of antiquity, Zera, or Osarkon, gathered
together an army of a million foot
soldiers, reinforced with three hundred
chariots, and journeyed toward Palestine to
loot the land. The vicinity of Mareshah was
chosen as the site of the battle and Asa came
out with his pitiful little company to defend
his possessions. The drama of this record
begins in the eleventh verse of the fourteenth
chapter of II Chronicles in the great prayer
of Asa:</p>
<h3 id="pl30">Plate 30</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig44">
<img src="images/p45.jpg" alt="" width="674" height="1001" />
<p class="pcap">Enroute to the &ldquo;High Place&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="pl31">Plate 31</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig45">
<img src="images/p46.jpg" alt="" width="671" height="999" />
<p class="pcap">The Altar of Sacrifice</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and
said, Lord, it is nothing with thee to help,
whether with many, or with them that have
no power: help us, O Lord our God; for we
rest on thee, and in thy name we go against
this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God;
let not man prevail against thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The high-hearted courage and simple faith
of Asa is sufficient introduction to the very
natural result, which follows in simple words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Asa,
and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We then read a condensed account of the
pursuit that Asa and his people indulged in,
chasing the horde of Egyptians all the way
across their own border. They were in such
confusion that they could not recover and
make a stand, so that not even a rear-guard
action was fought. The children of Israel
recaptured all of the cities that Rehoboam
had lost, and with a typical Hebraism the
account concludes with the statement that
&ldquo;they carried away exceeding much spoil.&rdquo;
Although they never recovered the golden
shields, it is to be hoped they got their equivalent
in the value of this recounted spoil.</p>
<p>It was the universal custom of conquerors
to record their victories and say nothing of
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
their defeats. Therefore, it is a bit startling
to find this record of II Chronicles borne out
by the account the Egyptian monarch has left
of his own campaigns. This simple paragraph
is illuminating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen campaigns I waged. In sixteen
of them I was victorious. In the seventeenth
campaign I was defeated. Not by man,
Heaven fought against me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So even in the record of a defeat this man
can brag that his strength and greatness were
so phenomenal that only the Lord could overthrow
him. Once again, a dead man tells a
tale. He also, in the illuminating account
that he has left, rises from the dead to write
&ldquo;o. k.&rdquo; across the pages of Holy Writ, attesting
its historical fidelity and the accuracy
of its records.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />Mingled Voices</h2>
<p>The next definite contact between Israel
and Egypt is found in the graphic and terse
statement of II Kings 17:4,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And the king of Assyria found conspiracy
in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So
king of Egypt, and brought no present to the
king of Assyria, as he had done year by year:
therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and
bound him in prison.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this point on, the records of Egypt
and Palestine are so enmeshed and tangled
with the records of Babylon and Assyria that
we cannot separate them in their presentation.
This king So is identified as the Egyptian
monarch Shabaka, who is also known
by the names Sebichos, Sabakon, Sabacoa,
and Seve. He seems to have been a man
of implacable cruelty, if we may judge from
the Greek record of his manner of succession.
He was preceded on the throne by Bakenrenef,
who was one of the wise and kindly
lawgivers of Egypt. This noble ruler was
one of the first of all the Egyptian kings to
come in direct contact with the classical
Greeks. The Dorian invasion had now come
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
to an end and the Greeks were free to trade
and colonize in the Mediterranean, and in the
vigour of their advance they had pressed on
to the mouth of the Nile. They had established
a close connection with Sais, and by
700 B. C. had entrenched themselves strongly
in the culture of that section of Egypt.</p>
<p>The Pharaoh of our present interest, So,
invaded that section of Egypt and captured
Bakenrenef in a swift and short campaign.
The Greek records relate that after treating
his defeated enemy with brutality, So then
burned him alive. He then established himself
as king and ruled not only all of Egypt
but Ethiopia as well. He was thus a contemporary
of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib,
all of whom have a direct bearing
upon the records of the Old Testament. One
of the interesting discoveries made at the
royal library at Nineveh was a seal bearing
the name of Shabaka, or So. The visitor to
the British Museum, upon entering the Assyrian
Room, may pause before Table Case
&ldquo;E&rdquo; and see this fascinating exhibit of the
actualities of these events.</p>
<p>In about the year 700 B. C., according to
the record of Holy Writ, when Shalmaneser
had dealt kindly with Hoshea, who had accepted
his yoke and agreed to pay tribute,
the faithless king of Judah entered into conspiracy
with Sebakah. Since the common
name, So, is the one that is used in the Scripture,
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">271</span>
we shall refer to this pharaoh by that
name from this point on. The tribute that
Hoshea should have paid to the king of Assyria
he diverted, and paid it into the hand
of So for the help that was promised him in
throwing off the yoke of Assyria. There is
abundant reason to believe, from all the collateral
records, that this conspiracy was promoted
by So and Hoshea.</p>
<p>This action on the part of the Hebrew king
was entirely unwarranted and consisted of a
breach of faith on his part. Indeed, the
prophet Hosea utters a stern and unmistakable
reproof against this action in the strong
words of the first verse of his twelfth chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ephraim feedeth on wind and followeth
after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies
and desolation; and they do make a covenant
with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into
Egypt. The Lord hath also a controversy
with Judah, and will punish Jacob according
to his ways; according to his doings will he
recompense him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of this conspiracy, Hoshea was
captured by the king of Assyria and carried
away into an imprisonment. The plan did
not work out as the faithless allies had intended.
Shalmaneser invaded Palestine to
punish this rebellion. This wise and able
general divided his forces, so that a major
portion of his military strength lay between
Egypt and Palestine at a part of the border
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
that was easily defended. When So found
that the cost of reaching Hoshea with aid
was to be a major battle which would endanger
his entire dominion, he simply defaulted
and left Hoshea to bear alone the
brunt of the battle. The prophecy of Hosea
was thus literally fulfilled. With the faithlessness
that Hoshea had manifested toward
Shalmaneser, he had been rewarded by the
defection of So from his covenant.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that So seemed to
have been a little ashamed of his conduct,
for he offers a rather flimsy excuse for his
failure to stand by his contract. His statement
is that Hoshea had paid only half of
the price agreed upon and for that reason
he came not to his aid.</p>
<p>In this invasion of Shalmaneser&rsquo;s, many
of the Hebrew people were taken captive.
Hoshea, after being for some time incarcerated
in disgrace and punishment, was forgiven
by Shalmaneser and restored to his
throne and dominion. Shalmaneser seems to
have reasoned that having once failed and
having tasted of punishment, Hoshea was
now to be trusted. Thus, the first conspiracy
ended with the common people of Samaria
paying the price. Two years later the faithless
and foolish Hoshea again listened to the
siren song of rebellion as it was sung by
the deceitful So and again rebelled against
his over-lord and benefactor. Shalmaneser,
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
in great wrath, again moved against Samaria,
which resisted in a bitter struggle that lasted
three years.</p>
<p>Although the following details are not all
mentioned in the text of II Kings, seventeenth
chapter, they are emphasized by the
change of person in the record. In this bitter
conflict of three years, no help came from
Egypt. The seventh verse of the text says
that the children of Israel had sinned against
the Lord, their God. They had gone again
into idolatry and had put themselves back
under the yoke of Egypt, from which God had
repeatedly redeemed them. The miserable
and faithless So turned out to be a bruised
reed indeed! But while this campaign was
being fought, Shalmaneser disappeared. A
revolution took place in the homeland and
the common oriental disease which may be
described as six inches of steel between the
ribs, quietly removed Shalmaneser from the
scene. A usurper named Sargon, who writes
his own genealogy and calls himself &ldquo;the son
of Nobody,&rdquo; succeeded to the throne.</p>
<p>Thus in the seventeenth chapter of II Kings
we have many royal persons, and in order
to keep the records straight, we set them
forth this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hoshea was the king of Samaria; and he
reigned over Israel nine years.</p>
<p>Shalmaneser the Fifth was the king of Assyria,
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
who is mentioned in the third verse by
name.</p>
<p>The fourth verse continues a record of Shalmaneser,
in carrying away Hoshea and punishing
him.</p>
<p>So is the pharaoh with whom we have been
dealing.</p>
<p>The king of Assyria who is not named in the
sixth verse, is Sargon, who succeeded to the
throne after the probable murder of Shalmaneser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Sargon is the second man of that name
to have reigned in Assyria. The time of his
reign may be given as from 722-705 B. C. The
first Sargon reigned sometime in the twentieth
century, B. C.</p>
<p>Sargon the Second thus reigned for almost
eighteen years. He was a war-loving
monarch, and that eighteen year reign was
one continuous, unbroken series of foreign
campaigns. Combining his forces with the
small host of the Philistines, he joined battle
with the Egyptians at Raphia. Going directly
to this campaign, after the termination
of his campaign against Samaria, he administered
a crushing defeat to the forces of So
and had no further difficulty with this
pharaoh during the balance of his reign.</p>
<p>In the British Museum, Table Case &ldquo;B,&rdquo;
which occupies a section of the second Northern
gallery of the Assyrian Room, contains
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
some magnificent baked clay cylinders which
are the original annals of Sargon. These
priceless records came from the ruins of a
tremendous building excavated by M. Botta
at the ancient site of Khorsabad, which was
later proved to have been the palace of Sargon.
Most of the sculptured objects from
this discovery are in the Museum at Paris.
These written records, however, which are
of infinitely more value to the student, are
fortunately on deposit in the British Museum.</p>
<p>In the Assyrian Saloon of the British
Museum the interested student will also behold
an inscription bearing the identification
number 12, whereupon are recorded the
names and titles of Sargon the Second, together
with a brief and epitomized account
of his conquests in various sections along
the coast lands of the Mediterranean, including
his famous victory in Judah.</p>
<p>A more complete record is found in the
Assyrian Room. In Table Case &ldquo;E,&rdquo; exhibits
11 and 12, are two nine-sided prisms containing
a graphic account of the expeditions of
Sargon. All of his campaigns in Palestine
are covered and include his conquest of
Israel, which he calls &ldquo;Omri land.&rdquo; (These
exhibits are identified by the Museum numbers
22,505 and 108,775.)</p>
<p>A further record of Sargon&rsquo;s bearing upon
the text of the Old Testament will be found
in the Assyrian Room in wall case No. 9. Exhibits
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
1-11 are fragments of an eight-sided
cylinder containing part of the records of
Sargon, particularly recording the campaign
against Ashdod, which is also preserved for
us by Isaiah in the twentieth chapter, verse
one. The people of Ashdod had made a
league with Judah and this outburst of
Isaiah&rsquo;s was a stern reproof against this procedure.
The prophet objected chiefly because
the league depended upon the strength
of Egypt. To the end of his life, Isaiah never
gave up his justified distrust of that country.
This, in a brief summary, presents the records
of Shalmaneser and Sargon as they authenticate
the Biblical account of the conduct
of the wretched So. Sargon recounts
that Azuri, who was king of Ashdod, had refused
to pay the tribute that was due to
the Assyrians. Consequently he was deposed
by Sargon, who elevated his brother Akhimiti
to the place of dominion. Whereupon the
people of Ashdod rebelled and raised Yamini
to the throne. They then entered into a
conspiracy with Philistea, Edom, Moab,
Egypt, and Judah. Sargon recounts their defeat
and the bringing back under the sway
of his yoke the cities and peoples who joined
the conspiracy.</p>
<p>A graphic and significant story is contained
in the brief and short words of Sargon&rsquo;s own
record&mdash;&ldquo;Samaria, I looked at. I captured.
27,280 families who remained therein I carried
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
away.&rdquo; The tragic end of Hoshea and
all of his noble counselors and advisers is
thus summed up in a brief and terrible sentence.</p>
<p>Sargon the Second was followed in turn
by Sennacherib, of whom a great deal is
known from his monuments. Their testimony
coincides with the story of the Southern
Kingdom during the reign of Hezekiah.
Three years after the ascension of Hoshea
to the throne of Israel, Hezekiah began to
reign over Judah at Jerusalem. He had a
long and interesting reign, occupying the
throne for twenty-five years. In the course
of his reign, Sargon the Second died, and
Sennacherib inherited the throne.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the success of his predecessor
Sargon in foreign campaigns, Sennacherib
invaded Judah to round out his empire.
Hezekiah accepted his yoke without
offering resistance, and paid him a vast tribute.</p>
<p>We are now in the eighteenth chapter of
II Kings which repeats part of the events of
the tragedy in Israel as they were observed
by the scribe in Judah. The invasions of
Shalmaneser and Sargon are recapitulated
and the carrying away of the people of Samaria
by Sargon is again authenticated. But
the scribe is more interested in recording
the events that make so stirring a chapter
in the closing days of the kingdom of Judah.
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
In verses thirteen to seventeen, the story of
this first invasion and the surrender of Sennacherib,
is told in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah
did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up
against all the fenced cities of Judah, and
took them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the
king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have
offended; return from me: that which thou
puttest on me will I bear. And the king of
Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of
Judah three hundred talents of silver and
thirty talents of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that
was found in the house of the Lord, and in
the treasures of the king&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold
from the doors of the temple of the Lord,
and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of
Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king
of Assyria.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the sixteenth and seventeenth
verses of the eighteenth chapter of II Kings,
ten silent years roll by. They are voiceless
as far as our text is concerned, but they are
vocal when we listen to the monuments.</p>
<p>It may have been about 705 B. C. when
Hezekiah accepted the yoke of Sennacherib.
In the meantime Sennacherib had strengthened
his alliances and was prepared to essay
a conflict with Egypt. The nephew of So,
who is called Tirhakah in the Bible, murdered
the successor of So, which was his son, Shabataka.
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
Having gained an empire by this
ruthless spilling of the blood of the rightful
heir, Tirhakah began an ill-fated reign. He
rashly matched strength with Sennacherib,
who was more than willing to add Egypt to
the nations who bore his yoke. The armies
of Assyria and Egypt joined battle at the
border at the site of Libnah and a mighty
conflict resulted. Realizing the strategic importance
of an enemy who would threaten
the rear of the Assyrian host, Tirhakah made
overtures to Hezekiah and invited him to
join in a rebellion to throw off the yoke of
Assyria. Hezekiah being willing to save the
enormous tribute that beggared his country
annually, listened to the voice of Isaiah who
advised him to join the rebellion. So Hezekiah
pronounced defiance against Sennacherib
and all of the Assyrian hordes and announced
the independence of Judah. The
battle of Libnah was then fought, and Tirhakah
was disgracefully defeated. The pitiful
remnant of his army fled and left Sennacherib
the unchallenged conqueror of his
day.</p>
<p>The position of Hezekiah can well be imagined.
The strength and might of Egypt had
been brushed aside by the armed power of
Assyria, and tiny Judah was put in the position
of defying the greatest military power
of that era. While Sennacherib was busy in
a mopping-up campaign at Libnah, he sent
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
three trusted generals to lay siege to Jerusalem
and to demand the surrender of Hezekiah.
The blasphemous oration of one of these
generals, Rab-shakeh, is given voluminously
in the eighteenth chapter of II Kings.
There was a good deal of truth in some of
Rab-shakeh&rsquo;s arguments. He described Pharaoh
as &ldquo;a bruised reed upon which if a
man leaned, it would pierce his hand and
wound him to the death.&rdquo; He rightly said
that no other countries had been delivered
from Sennacherib by the power of their gods.
His error was in assuming that therefore the
God of Israel would also be defeated by the
power of Sennacherib. He gave the king
some short while to think over the policy
of surrender, and sat down to invest the city.
Hezekiah, in his bitter dilemma, sought out
Isaiah, whose advice he had followed with
such disastrous results.</p>
<p>The thirty-seventh chapter of Isaiah contains
the answer that Isaiah made, and the
exact words of his prophecy are also found
in the nineteenth chapter of II Kings, verses
six and seven. To comfort Hezekiah, Isaiah
said to the king&rsquo;s messenger: &ldquo;Thus shall ye
say to your master, Thus saith the Lord,
Be not afraid of the words that thou hast
heard wherewith the servants of the king of
Assyria have blasphemed me. Behold, I will
send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
rumour, and return to his own land; and I
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
will cause him to fall by the sword in his
own land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is well to keep this prophecy of Isaiah&rsquo;s
in mind until we see how perfectly it was
fulfilled in complete detail. In the thirty-fifth
verse of II Kings, the nineteenth chapter,
the &ldquo;blast&rdquo; occurred. The statement is
made that the angel of the Lord went out and
slew 185,000 of the flower of the Assyrian
army.</p>
<p>The next verse says in graphic words, &ldquo;So
Sennacherib king of Assyria departed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The literal translation in English of that
graphic word would be, &ldquo;So Sennacherib
king of Assyria &lsquo;beat it&rsquo;.&rdquo; We cannot blame
him for the haste of his departure. Arising
after a night of slumber to find 185,000 of
his best warriors mysteriously slain, terror
must have smitten his heart. At that exact
moment word reached him of a rebellion in
his own land. This was the &ldquo;rumour&rdquo; of
which Isaiah had prophesied. He returned
to put down this rebellion and never again
invaded Judah.</p>
<p>Twenty years later he was murdered. Between
verses thirty-six and thirty-seven of
the nineteenth chapter of II Kings, a full
score of years passed by. After his murder,
his son, Esar-haddon, came to the throne and
continued the story of conquest and intrigue.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the defeated Tirhakah
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
was unquestionably chagrined to learn that
little Judah had been delivered from the
power that had defeated him. To apologize
for his own failure to support Judah, Tirhakah
claimed credit for the defeat of the
Assyrian horde by claiming that his god,
Amon, had caused the camp of the Assyrians
to be invaded by millions of field mice. He
claimed that these tiny rodents in one night
ate up all the bowstrings of the army and thus
they were unable to fight. His interpretation
of the event is a bit sketchy, to say the
least!</p>
<p>In the Assyrian Room at the British Museum,
a very important exhibit will be seen
in Table Case &ldquo;E&rdquo;. This is a six-sided clay
prism containing an unabridged record of
Sennacherib&rsquo;s own account of these stirring
events. Here he has given us his story of
the invasion of Palestine and the siege of
Jerusalem in the days of Hezekiah. So important
is this record that we produce here,
in its entirety, the fifth oblique (or plane)
of this great prism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In my third campaign I went to the land of
the Hittites. I marched against the City of
Ekron and put to death the priests and chief
men who had committed the sin of rebellion
and I hung up their bodies on stakes all
around the City ... but as for Hezekiah of
Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke
46 of his strong cities, together with innumerable
fortresses and small towns that depended
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
upon them by overthrowing the walls
and open attack, by battle, engines and battering
rams I besieged I captured; I brought
out of the midst of them and counted as a
spoil 200,000 persons great and small, male
and female, besides mules, camels, sheep,
asses and oxen without number:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hezekiah himself I shut up like a bird in a
cage in Jerusalem his strong city. I built
a line of forts against him and kept back
himself from going forth out of the great
gate of his city. I cut off his cities which I
had spoiled out of the midst of his land and
I gave them to Metinti, king of Ashdod, and
Padi King of Ekron and Til-Baal, King of
Gaza and made his country small. In addition
to their former yearly tribute and gifts
I added other tribute and homage due to my
majesty, and I laid it upon them. The fear
of the greatness of my majesty overwhelmed
him, even Hezekiah, and he sent after me to
Nineveh my royal city, the Arabs and his
bodyguards, whom he had brought for the
defense of his royal city Jerusalem, and had
furnished with pay along with thirty talents....
Eight hundred talents of pure silver, carbuncles
and other precious stones, a couch
of ivory, thrones of ivory, and elephants hide
and elephant tusks, rare woods of all kinds
a vast treasure, as well as Unachs from his
palace, and dancing men and dancing women.
And he sent his Ambassador to offer homage.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This fascinating document is one of the
greatest treasures that archeology has produced
for the careful student of Christian
apologetics. It is notable not only for what
it tells but also for much that is left unsaid.
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
In the grim, brutal days of these ancient
conquerors, a defeated enemy could expect
little mercy at the hands of the victorious.
The kings of Assyria ruled by fear and by
the implacable, swift certainty of punishment
for rebellion. Sennacherib here refers to a
common practice of his day, that of impaling
rebellious enemies as a lesson to other vassals.
In this particular document he recounts
how they hung the bodies of the rebel leaders
on stakes around their captured cities.</p>
<p>The technique of this execution was simple.
A heavy post was driven into the ground
until it was about as high as a tall man&rsquo;s
shoulder. The top of the post was sharpened
to as fine a point as the tools of that day
would permit. In some cases, the rebel was
picked up by a pair of burly executioners
who swung him through the air and jammed
him down with great force upon the pointed
stake. There they whirled him as a sort of
a human pinwheel until life quickly fled his
shattered form. This was a comparatively
merciful way of impaling. In other cases
the victim was set upon the sharpened stick
until gravity bore down his suffering body
to the point where death relieved him after
hours, and even days of misery and torment.</p>
<p>But while Sennacherib recounted the successful
punishment of the rebels of the many
cities who had joined in this uprising, it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
to be carefully noted that he changed the
tone of the record in the case of Hezekiah.
He could not say that he impaled him or
otherwise punished him for the rebellion!
All he could say was, &ldquo;As for Hezekiah himself,
I shut him up like a bird in Jerusalem,
his capital city.&rdquo; Sennacherib can tell of
the fenced cities and small villages in the
outskirts of Judah which he despoiled from
the hand of Hezekiah, but he never laid hand
on the person of the king himself, nor did
he enter the sacred city. The &ldquo;blast&rdquo; of
Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy can alone account for the
failure of Sennacherib to crucify Hezekiah
along with his other rebellious enemies.</p>
<p>Also it is to be noted that by a violation
of chronological accuracy, Sennacherib &ldquo;saves
face,&rdquo; after the ancient custom of the Eastern
lands. A conqueror of his standing and authority
cannot admit that he was defeated
before the walls of Jerusalem. Therefore,
at the end of this record he gives a list of
the treasure <i>that Hezekiah had paid before in
his original subjection</i>! This listing of tribute
is falsely made to appear as though it were
<i>after</i> the siege of Jerusalem. By the simple
expedient of introducing at the end of a defeat
the record of a previous payment, Sennacherib
seeks to delude posterity and wipe
out the memory of his one outstanding defeat.
This great prism of this Assyrian conqueror
is unquestionably one of the strongest bricks
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
in the wall of defense that archeology is erecting
around the Sacred Word of God.</p>
<p>There are many other records left by Sennacherib
that are also of tremendous importance.
The British Museum has a magnificent
section which is devoted very largely to
those Babylonian and Assyrian chronicles,
many of which coincide with this period of
history. The murder of Sennacherib that
was prophesied by Isaiah and recorded in the
nineteenth chapter of II Kings, is accredited
and substantiated by archeological sources.</p>
<p>We learn from the records of Babylon that
the years between the debacle at Jerusalem
and the death of Sennacherib were occupied
with wars much nearer home. We read in
those chronicles that the Elamites of Suziana,
together with certain allied peoples, again
rose in rebellion. It took a number of campaigns,
which ultimately ravished the whole
of Suziana, to put down this uprising. In
fact, the campaigns of subjection were not
entirely successful until Babylon was destroyed
in 689 B. C. In the interim, when
not busy subduing his Elamite subjects, Sennacherib
campaigned in Cilicia, where he
overcame the armed force of the Greeks,
penetrating as far as Tarsus in his victorious
marches. The Babylonian records conclude
by saying that he was assassinated by his
sons in the year which by our reckoning
would be known as B. C. 681.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>In the Babylonian Room of the British
Museum, Table Case &ldquo;E&rdquo; contains an exhibit
which bears the Museum number 92,502. This
consists of a clay tablet which is an extensive
chronicle written in the Babylonian characters.
It delineates a list of the principal
events which occurred in both Babylon and
Assyria over an extensive period of time.</p>
<p>The history begins with the third year of
the reign of Nabu-Nasir, who ascended his
throne in Babylon in 744. The record continues
to the first year of Shamash-shum-ukim,
with whom we shall deal in a future
reference. In the third column of this chronicle,
lines thirty-four and thirty-five state that
Sennacherib was killed by his son on the
twentieth day of the month Tebet in the
twenty-third year of his reign. This murder
is rather graphically described in terse, but
satisfactory terms in the record of the nineteenth
chapter of II Kings.</p>
<p>There is no more definite and positive example
of the coincidence of archeological discovery
with the text of the Scripture than
is provided by the records of Sennacherib.
Though dead for more than two and one-half
millenniums, he indeed has a tale to tell!
We can condense his record into one graphic,
simple sentence which we can sign with the
name of this great king, &ldquo;The historicity of
the Sacred Page is unquestionable in the
light of archeology!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>The next pharaoh of antiquity who challenges
our interest with his confirmation of
the Scripture, is variously known by the
name of Necho, which is his prenomen as
used in the Scripture text, and by the Egyptian
forms of Nekau and Uohemibra. He
was, perhaps, the greatest of the later conquerors
who sought to extend the power of
Egypt, and he was certainly the last of that
remarkable group. He expended a good deal
of the revenues of the crown in rebuilding
the canal of Seti the First, which had formed
a waterway between the Nile and the Red
Sea. It is difficult at times to place absolute
credence upon the numerical estimates of
the ancient chronicles of Egypt, but it is
highly probable that Necho employed more
than a hundred thousand men in this work.
Herodotus gives great honour to Necho, telling
us that he sent out certain ships of
Phoenicia which circumnavigated Africa. He
maintained a mercenary army of Greeks, and
had one fleet in the Mediterranean, and the
other in the Red Sea. His record in the Scripture
is tangled inextricably with that of
Assyria and Babylonia, and for that reason
we must sketch-in the background of this
coincidence and appearance.</p>
<p>Shalmaneser the Fifth began the phenomenal
rise to ascendency of the great power
of Assyria. Babylon was the chief adversary
and the strongest foe that Assyria faced in
<span class="pb" id="Page_289">289</span>
the development of her world empire, which
ultimately climaxed in Sennacherib. Finding
it impossible to preserve the loyalty of
the Babylonians, who were a proud and
haughty people, Sennacherib finally destroyed
Babylon and carried away its people
into captivity. When Sennacherib died, according
to the record of the nineteenth chapter
of II Kings, his son, Esar-haddon came
to the throne. Esar-haddon, more of a statesman
than a conqueror, rebuilt Babylon. He
united Assyria and Babylon into one great
domain, naming the combined kingdom
Babylonia. For the sake of administration
and as a gesture of amity, he made Babylon
his capital. Thus the rebuilt city became the
seat of government and the center of the culture
of Babylonia.</p>
<p>The name Esar-haddon means &ldquo;victorious,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;conqueror.&rdquo; One of the greatest of all
the mighty kings of Assyria, he was a worthy
successor of Sargon, Shalmaneser, and Sennacherib.
His name occurs but three times
in Holy Writ. The first occurrence is II Kings
19:37, where it speaks of his ascent to the
throne. The next occurrence is in Isaiah
37:28 where this record of II Kings 19:37 is
confirmed by the hand of the prophet, who
was an active participant in those stirring
events. Later, Ezra refers to him in the
second verse of his fourth chapter. In this
latter reference, the remnant who returned
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
from the Babylonian captivity name him as
the cause of their captivity and acknowledged
that he gave them the freedom to worship
their own God in their own way.</p>
<p>In the reign of Menasseh, Esar-haddon died
and was succeeded by two sons. The elder
of these was the famous Assur-bani-pal, who
was made over-lord of the entire kingdom,
with the section that was once called Assyria
as his particular domain. His younger
brother, Shamis-shum-ukim was given dominion
over Babylon, where he reigned as
vassal to his wealthy brother. The British
Museum is replete with the records and materials
from the reign of Assur-bani-pal and
from the brief and tragic rule of Shamis-shum-ukim
as well.</p>
<p>The fine hand of Egyptian intrigue enters
into the record at this point, again tangling
up the Assyrian records in a triangular bout
between Judah, Egypt, and Babylonia. The
Pharaoh Necho, alarmed by the growing
power of Babylonia, gathered together a
mighty host and invaded the territory of the
great Assyrian king. As a preliminary to
this invasion, the Pharaoh Necho persuaded
Shamis-shum-ukim to rebel against his older
brother and to declare his independence. Into
this conspiracy Necho succeeded in drawing
Syria and Judah. The blow was struck at
the dominion of Assur-bani-pal while he was
battling certain tribes near his Eastern border.
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
When the couriers brought him word
of the revolt of his brother, and of the coalition
formed against him at the instigation
of Necho, Assur-bani-pal made a swift and
remarkable march, returning to his threatened
territory. Necho hastily assembled his
army, and the major battles were fought on
the terrain of Syria. Syria was quickly reduced,
Babylon pacified, and Assur-bani-pal
emerged completely victorious.</p>
<p>Necho, not having had time to prepare his
defenses, was overthrown, defeated, and
forced to bow in subjection to Assur-bani-pal.
From the record of the victorious king, we
offer the following paragraph as a condensed
but detailed account of these tremendous
events:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;After removing the corpses of the rebels
from the midst of Babylon, Cuthra, and Sippara,
and piling them in heaps, in accordance
with the prophecies I cleaned the mercy seats
of their temples. I purified their chief places
of prayer I appeased their angry gods and
goddesses with supplications and penitential
psalms. Their daily sacrifices which they had
discontinued, I restored and established as
they had been of old. As for the rest of them
who had flown at the stroke of slaughter, I had
mercy on them. I proclaimed an amnesty
upon them. I brought them to live in Babylon.
The men of the nations whom Sam
... had led away and united in one conspiracy,
I trod down to the uttermost parts
of their borders. By the command of Assur,
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">292</span>
Beltis, and the great gods my helpers, the
yoke of Assur which they had shaken off I
laid upon them. I appointed over them governors
and satraps, the work of my own
hands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this account it will be seen that
Assur-bani-pal slew his rebellious brother
and destroyed the principal leaders of the revolt,
with the exception of those who had
pleaded for mercy. As a result of this defeat
at Charchemish, Necho was dethroned and
led in chains to Babylon. This Chaldean conqueror
had a policy that was unique for his
day. It was his consistent practice to deal
mercifully with the repentant. When the
Pharaoh Necho professed sorrow for his conduct,
Assur-bani-pal, following his established
custom, restored him to Sais where he was
to rule Egypt as a province of Babylonia.</p>
<p>At this time, Josiah of Judah also accepted
the yoke of Assyria and became a vassal of
Assur-bani-pal. From what we learn of the
character of King Josiah, we would expect
that he would be faithful to his pledges and
promises and, indeed, this very faithfulness
was the cause of his death. The Pharaoh
Necho, smarting under his defeat and
wounded deeply in his pride, quietly gathered
together a tremendous army and rebelled
against Assur-bani-pal the second time.</p>
<p>In this second conflict, Charchemish was
the chosen battle ground. Although many
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
strategic battles had been waged back and
forth about this important center, this is
generally referred to as the First Battle of
Charchemish. This reference is undoubtedly
predicated upon the fact that the ultimate
struggle between Assyria and Egypt, which
gave the latter power a world dominion, centered
about this field.</p>
<p>In order to reach the battle ground, the
Pharaoh Necho marched his horde across
the terrain of Palestine. The story of what
followed is familiar to every student of the
Old Testament. In the thirty-fifth chapter
of II Chronicles, beginning with the twentieth
verse and ending with the twenty-seventh,
this incidental tragedy is told. Josiah, who
had taken the pledge of fidelity to Assur-bani-pal,
gathered together his small army
and sought to prevent this passage of the
Egyptian army across his domain. It is
recorded that Pharaoh sent his heralds to
Josiah offering to leave the land of Palestine
unmolested on condition that they gave him
no opposition in his plans for battle. The
pharaoh went so far as to claim that he was
on the business of God. Although King
Josiah had disguised himself in the common
dress of a humble man-at-arms, he seems
to have been recognized. The sharpshooters
among the archers picked him as their target
and he fell sorely wounded. He died after
being taken to Jerusalem, and all of the people
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
of Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.</p>
<p>Jeremiah the prophet deeply loved the
godly king because of his fidelity to the law,
and the fourth chapter of the Book of Lamentations
contains part of the dirge of Jeremiah
concerning the death of the king.</p>
<p>In the meantime, hindered by the abortive
attempt of the faithful Josiah to delay his
passage, Necho swept on to the banks of the
Euphrates where a notable battle was fought.
The assault of Necho found the Assyrian
monarch unprepared. The force that he had
gathered at Charchemish was inadequate to
defend his borders, and Assur-bani-pal was
defeated. In the meantime, Jehoahaz had
succeeded his father Josiah and was reigning
at Jerusalem. The sway of the young king
was short and ended tragically after ninety
days. On his way home from his victory at
Charchemish, the Pharaoh Necho deposed
Jehoahaz because of his father&rsquo;s conduct and
put Eliakim on the throne. Thus the younger
brother of Jehoahaz became king over Judah
in his place.</p>
<p>The Pharaoh changed the name of Eliakim
to Jehoiakim and once more Judah became a
vassal to the might and power of Egypt. The
unfortunate Jehoahaz, laden with chains, was
carried away to Sais. There he dragged out
a miserable existence until death brought
him a happy release from captivity and degradation.
The Pharaoh Necho imposed upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
Palestine a fine for their opposition which
would be about the equivalent in our modern
currency of $200,000. In considering the difference
in purchasing power, however, that
would be about $3,000,000 in our money.</p>
<p>These incidents are either expressly stated
or are referred to in many portions of Holy
Writ. We first find them in the twenty-third
chapter of II Kings.</p>
<p>The twenty-sixth chapter of Jeremiah,
verses twenty-one to twenty-three, contains
a bleak record of the hardship and oppression
that resulted when men of God were slain
for speaking God&rsquo;s Word concerning the
events of this grim and dismal affair.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth chapter of Ezekiel, the
third and fourth verses of this record, the
prophet sings a lamentation over the &ldquo;lion&rsquo;s
whelp&rdquo; and sorrows that &ldquo;he shall be bound
in chains in the land of Egypt.&rdquo; Then from
the fifth verse on, the prophet caustically
berates the land because that another of the
lion&rsquo;s whelps, suddenly raised to maturity,
devoured the men who had raised him and
laid waste their land and cities.</p>
<p>Our present interest, however, is to be
found in the records that deal with these
events in the sources of archeology. It would
be inconceivable that the mighty Necho
should fail to boast of his power and victory
when he had won so notable an ascendancy
over all of his enemies. In the voluminous
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
records of the Pharaoh Necho, the vainglorious
boasting of this long-dead monarch
comes to us today as a welcome, added voice
to the rapidly swelling chorus that testifies
to the historical accuracy of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Leaving the record of Necho, however, for
the present moment (as he enters the story
again in the reign of the succeeding Babylonian
monarch), we turn to the sources of
Babylonian and Assyrian antiquity for the
authentication of these affairs by the mighty
Assur-bani-pal. Now, indeed, it becomes difficult
to choose the most effective and pointed
evidences, as we are embarrassed with so
vast a wealth of material. It would take
many days indeed for a careful student to
exhaust the possibilities in that collection of
the material of Assur-bani-pal that is found
in the British Museum alone. In this notable
and incomparable deposit of priceless fact
and information, there is no more striking
section than that which is derived from the
works and records of this stormy ruler.</p>
<p>In about the year 666 B. C. this conqueror
finished the third of his campaigns against
Egypt, and with the sack of the City of
Thebes, again established the dominion of
Assyria over Egypt. The mighty king then
turned his military attentions to the northern
regions of his empire and thrust his borders
out to an unprecedented extent. At the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
time, with a part of his forces he waged a
long war with the Elamites on his southeastern
border and subjected that country to the
yoke of Assyria. Putting down the Elamite
uprising with a stern and bloody hand, he
left a lesson in implacable cruelty that the
Elamites never forgot.</p>
<p>In the Nineveh Gallery of the Assyrian
section of the British Museum may be seen
great sculptured slabs from the walls of Assur-bani-pal&rsquo;s
palace, which are numbered
45 to 50. At our last visit they were to be
seen on the Eastern side of the gallery. These
relics completely illustrate his conquest of
Elam. Exhibits 45 to 47 further show the
crushing of the Elamite forces, and the action
is so dramatically depicted that the careful
student may sense the excitement which
seems to prevail. A voluminous text accompanies
the pictured action so that there is
no possibility of mistaking the meaning of
the illustrations.</p>
<p>At this time Shamis-shum-ukim joined in
the great revolt to which we have referred
in a foregoing paragraph of this chapter.
There are two accounts in the archeological
records as to the end of Shamis-shum-ukim.
Although a twin brother of Assur-bani-pal,
he was some hours the younger, and thus was
nominally subject to him under Assyrian law.
One account says that he was taken prisoner
<span class="pb" id="Page_298">298</span>
and that Assur-bani-pal had him burned at
the stake. The other account says that Shamis-shum-ukim,
seeing he was about to be defeated,
locked himself in a small section of
the palace, which he set afire and burned
himself rather than surrender. There was
at this time a revolt in the Egyptian section
of the empire which resulted in some long
conflicts, which are also given in these records.
It was also at this period that Assur-bani-pal
left the record above cited, of the
pacification of Babylon and the submission
of Josiah.</p>
<p>The British Museum has a very large collection
of letters from the library of Assur-bani-pal
at Nineveh, many of which are of
high significance in the study of these historical
episodes. These letters cover a broad
scope as they include the reports, requisitions,
and communications of dignitaries.
Some of these came from the crown prince,
others from local governors and still more
from various military captains. They deal
in specific detail with military operations,
uprisings, rebellions, and their suppression.
They tell of the dispatch of troops to the
provinces, with lists of expenses and expenditures.
Such intimate details of Assyrian science
as the reports of astronomers for regulating
the calendar of the year are found
there, and illuminating comments upon the
political trend of the days. There are many
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">299</span>
references to these episodes, as would naturally
be expected.</p>
<p>One of the great monuments to be found
in the Babylonian Room of the British
Museum, and numbered 90,864, is a stone
stele with a rounded top, that is a treasure
indeed. The upright full-length figure of
Assur-bani-pal is shown in his capacity of
high priest. This stele contains a lengthy
chronicle recording the names, honors, and
genealogy of the monarch and tells of his
godly conduct and fidelity to his religion.
There is a note of sadness and an index to
the character of this great Assyrian in the
line where Assur-bani-pal declares that he
himself had appointed his twin brother
Shamis-shum-ukim &ldquo;to the sovereignty over
Babylon so that the strong may not oppress
the weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing over a great many of these sources,
we come now to the Assyrian Room where,
in Table Case &ldquo;E,&rdquo; we find two ten-sided
prisms of Assur-bani-pal which bear the
Museum numbers 91,026, and 91,086. These
lengthy records are inscribed with the outstanding
incidents in the earlier years of his
busy life. Beginning with an epitomized
statement concerning his birth and education,
as all good biographies should begin, he took
occasion to recognize the great prosperity of
Assyria that immediately followed his elevation
to the throne. Then quickly the warrior
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
king launched into some graphic descriptions
of his principal military expeditions. Here
he tells of the two expeditions against Tirhakah
in Egypt, to which we have referred
above. Among the allies who accompanied
him to fight under his banner, who were already
subject to him, he mentions levies
from Cypress, Asia Minor, Syria, and <i>Palestine</i>.
After citing the events and victories
of five campaigns, the record then introduces
the sad tragedy of Shamis-shum-ukim, a portion
of which we have cited in a preceding
paragraph. In all, there are nine campaigns
covered in these prisms, and the student of
historical accuracy may find great substantiation
for his confidence in the truth and
fidelity of the Word of God from these fascinating
records.</p>
<p>In the same case is an eight-sided clay
prism of Assur-bani-pal, numbered 93,008.
This also contains a shorter reference to
these same events. To convey an adequate
and detailed account of the materials available
from the time of Assur-bani-pal and his
unfortunate brother would require a large
volume by itself. We have come to that
point, however, where Assur-bani-pal&rsquo;s record
concludes as it touches the Scripture. So
we satisfy ourselves temporarily with this
brief introduction of an epitomized section
of those evidences.</p>
<p>Three years after the battle of Charchemish,
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">301</span>
where Assur-bani-pal was temporarily
defeated, a new and forceful conqueror appeared
in the person of Nebuchadnezzar the
Second. Assur-bani-pal was succeeded by
Nabopolassar, who will be ignored in this
record because of the fact that he is not
named by name in the text of the Bible.
Nabopolassar, however, had a gifted son
who succeeded him as Nebuchadnezzar the
Second, and who began his training for the
crown by assuming command of the army as
the chief general under his father and with
his parent&rsquo;s consent.</p>
<p>The first great campaign that Nebuchadnezzar
fought, brought Egypt back under the
dominion of Babylon. To see the background
of this event, it must be noted that after the
death of Assur-bani-pal, the Medes invaded
Nineveh and captured that stronghold.
Whereupon Nabopolassar reasserted the independence
of Babylon and conducted a number
of brilliant campaigns to secure the
ascendency of his kingdom and to establish
his supremacy over the entire ancient world.</p>
<p>When Nineveh fell, the Pharaoh Necho,
with whom we are now dealing, entered the
story again. Necho invaded Syria and Palestine
and successfully campaigned up to the
banks of the Euphrates. At Charchemish he
met the host of Nebuchadnezzar for what is
known as the Second Battle of Charchemish.
Necho entered this conflict with considerable
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
confidence, due to his previous victory on
this same field. This time, however, a different
experience awaited him. Nebuchadnezzar
crushed the Egyptians with an overwhelming
defeat and drove them back to
their own border. As a result of this battle,
all Palestine, with the exception of Judah,
acknowledged the authority of Nebuchadnezzar.
The Babylonian general took Jehoiakim
captive and slew the Pharaoh Necho.</p>
<p>All of these events are recorded by the
Pharaoh Necho, by Assur-bani-pal, and by
certain humbler captains and leaders. The
Pharaoh&rsquo;s record is complete up to the time
of the second battle. But as Necho did not
survive this campaign, there is a dramatic
break in his record. However, what is wanting
from the Egyptian sources, is happily
supplied from those of Babylon.</p>
<p>It is not to be expected that the young
conqueror would remain silent concerning
his early victories. His father, Nabopolassar,
also recounts with some satisfaction
the military ability of his son. Through
all of his reign, however, Nebuchadnezzar
was more of a builder and architect than
conqueror, although he frequently took the
field in notable military action. Most of the
relics from his reign have to do with the
building of great temples and edifices. There
are, however, a number of fragmentary
chronicles such as that which, in the Babylonian
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
Room of the British Museum in Table
Case &ldquo;E,&rdquo; bears the number of 33,041. This
recounts a later expedition undertaken by
Nebuchadnezzar in the thirty-seventh year
of his reign. This was to put down an uprising
in Egypt.</p>
<p>There are innumerable tablets and records
in the British Museum that attest the order
and genius of the government in the forty-two
years of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s reign. We
will refer to this later when we come to the
closing period of his great career. We have
introduced the historicity of Nebuchadnezzar
now, and the coincidence of his account which
climaxes the reign of Necho, to establish at
one more point the historical accuracy of
the Old Testament text.</p>
<p>The last Pharaoh who comes into the account
of the Sacred Book is positively identified
as Hophra. He is called Apris by the
Greeks, and is frequently found in the hieroglyphics
under the name of Psammetichus,
the Second. His name, Hophra, occurs in
the Scripture only once, which is the forty-fourth
chapter of Jeremiah and the thirtieth
verse. Here the three great characters of
this last drama are found conjoined in these
simple words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord; Behold I will give
Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand
of his enemies, and into the hand of them
that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king
<span class="pb" id="Page_304">304</span>
of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought
his life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hophra was a rash, inexperienced, over-confident
ruler who wasted what small
strength and wealth his kingdom possessed
in useless warfare against mighty powers
which were manifestly beyond his ability to
cope with. The background of his contact
with the Sacred Record begins with his conspiracy
that enmeshed Zedekiah. This entire
rebellion was a faithless and degraded
example of lack of honour and responsibility
to a plighted and pledged word. This is primarily
so because after the defeat of Necho
and his subsequent death, Nebuchadnezzar
raised Hophra, the son of Necho, to the throne
of Egypt where he governed as a satrap. He
was to reign for Babylon, and had taken the
oath of fidelity to his over-lord and master.</p>
<p>To make matters worse the conduct of
Zedekiah added insult <i>to</i> injury! When Nebuchadnezzar
dethroned Jehoiakim and carried
him bound in chains to his subsequent death in
Babylon, he was followed on the throne by Jehoiakin
who reigned for a very brief period.
Then Nebuchadnezzar raised Zedekiah to a
position of power and on his twenty-first
birthday elevated him to the governorship of
Jerusalem. For the better part of eleven
years, he reigned more or less successfully.
He seems to have been a graceless scoundrel
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
and utterly without honour. Completely violating
their treaties and their oaths of fidelity,
Pharaoh and Zedekiah joined in a conspiracy
and rebelled against the power of
Nebuchadnezzar. It is a matter of wonder
to the modern student that these kings of
Judah never learned their lesson.</p>
<p>The Chaldeans besieged Jerusalem to put
down this revolt, and Hophra marched to
its aid. Because the company of Chaldeans
was small, as Nebuchadnezzar had not anticipated
a strong resistance, the wise captains
of this advance-guard did not join battle with
Hophra, but retired in good order rather than
fight a hopeless conflict when they were so
strongly outnumbered.</p>
<p>The city of Jerusalem went wild with delight
and rejoicing over its deliverance. The
gloomy Jeremiah warned the leaders in vain
that the Chaldeans would return, and in overwhelming
force. Refusing to listen to the
prophecies of Jeremiah, the people treated
him harshly and cast him out. While the
city was rejoicing at this early victory, Jeremiah
himself gave a manifestation of confidence
in the ultimate fulfillment of his own
prophecies, when he fled from the city and
delivered himself voluntarily into the hands
of the Chaldeans. In the meantime, Hophra,
overcome with pride at his easy victory,
boasted with blasphemy that not even could
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
God defeat him! The sycophantic Zedekiah
acquiesced in this boasting and blasphemy
and showered the foolish Hophra with unlimited
compliments.</p>
<p>With Jeremiah gone and all of Judah turning
to the ways of idolatry, God did not lack
champions. Messengers and prophets were
sent rapidly to Zedekiah and to the princes
of the kingdom, but they mocked the messengers
of God and despised His words. They
misused His prophets, until the wrath of the
Lord rose against His people beyond remedy.
Therefore, says the thirty-sixth chapter of
II Chronicles,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He brought upon them the king of the Chaldees,
who slew their young men with the
sword in the house of their sanctuary, and
had no compassion upon young man or maiden,
old man, or him that stooped for age; he
gave them all into his hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strongest voice that was raised for
God in this dark hour was that of Ezekiel. At
this time, the prophet was in Babylon and
from there he spoke the words that are found
in the first sixteen verses of his twenty-ninth
chapter. This is undoubtedly one of the most
comprehensive and remarkable prophecies
concerning any nation that the student of this
fascinating subject may deal with. For the
sake of refreshing the mind of the reader, we
publish here this prophecy in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in
the twelfth day of the month, the word of the
Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, set
thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:
Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord God;
Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of
Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst
of his rivers, which hath said, My river is
mine own, and I have made it for myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will
cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy
scales, and I will bring thee up out of the
midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy
rivers shall stick unto thy scales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness,
thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou
shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not
be brought together, nor gathered: I have
given thee for meat to the beast of the field
and to the fowls of the heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know
that I am the Lord, because they have been
a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they took hold of thee by thy hand,
thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder:
and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest,
and madest all their loins to be at a stand.
Therefore thus said the Lord God; Behold I
will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off
man and beast out of thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and
waste; and they shall know that I am the
Lord: because he hath said, The river is mine,
and I have made it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, therefore I am against thee, and
against thy rivers, and I will make the land
of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from
<span class="pb" id="Page_308">308</span>
the tower of Syene even unto the border of
Ethiopia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot
of beast shall pass through it, neither shall
it be inhabited forty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will make the land of Egypt desolate
in the midst of the countries that are desolate,
and her cities among the cities that are laid
waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will
scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and
will disperse them through the countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet thus saith the Lord God; At the end of
forty years will I gather the Egyptians from
the people whither they were scattered;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt,
and will cause them to return into the land
of Pathros, into the land of their habitation;
and they shall be there a base kingdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither
shall it exalt itself any more above the nations:
for I will diminish them, that they
shall no more rule over the nations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it shall be no more the confidence of
the house of Israel, which bringeth their iniquity
to remembrance, when they shall look
after them: but they shall know that I am
the Lord God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analyzing this prophecy, we note the personal
element that is introduced when God
arrayed himself against Hophra and all of
the land of Egypt. This people who, as we
have seen, worshipped the Nile and counted
it a deified object, had also acquiesced in the
claims of Hophra who went so far as to state
that he was the one who had made the river
and caused it to continue to flow. Adopting
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
this figure, the prophet speaking for God,
says that Hophra shall be caught like the
fish and cast into the fields by the side of
the banks.</p>
<p>The sixth verse states that all the population
of Egypt is to be taught a bitter lesson.
They shall know forever that God is Lord,
in the punishment they shall reap for their
defections against Israel.</p>
<p>Verse eight contains the information that
this punishment is to take the form of an
invasion that shall leave the land desolate and
waste. This punishment was to come upon
the land and the people because of their
idolatry and their sins against Israel.</p>
<p>From verses ten to twelve, a bleak picture
is drawn of utter desolation which shall prevail
in their land for forty years. The
prophecy then turns upon the pivot of the
thirteenth verse to a time of a partial restoration.
This restoration, however, is limited in
the Divine Word to the effect that Egypt
shall be the basest of the kingdoms of the
earth. It shall never be permitted to exalt
itself again in the council of the nations. It
is to be eternally diminished and debased.</p>
<p>The consequent history of Egypt has been
a complete vindication and fulfillment of this
prophecy. Nebuchadnezzar invaded Judah
and carried away the last remnant of that
graceless people into captivity in Babylon.
All those who had joined in the defection of
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">310</span>
Zedekiah, great and small, old and young,
they slew with the sword. Then the
angry Nebuchadnezzar swept on into Egypt
and devastated that land, until, it is recorded,
&ldquo;not a living thing, man or beast,&rdquo; was left
in that once populous country.</p>
<p>For forty years it lay, wasted and idle.
Then the counselors of Nebuchadnezzar advised
that the land be colonized in order that
it might produce revenue for the crown. The
first attempt failed because of the climate and
the unique conditions of agriculture in a
country that required constant irrigation and
whose crops depended upon the sole source
of moisture the river Nile. Therefore, the
counselors gathered together such remnant
of the Egyptians as remained from the captivity
and sent them back to repopulate the
land.</p>
<p>Every student of history will recall that
Egypt <i>has been</i> the basest of kingdoms from
that hour to this. It has been dominated in
turn by the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans,
the Arabs, the Turks, the French, and the
British.</p>
<p>One notable effort was made in historic
time to raise Egypt to its former grandeur
and power. The reader will recall the great
campaign of Napoleon by which he thought
to revive this Mistress of Antiquity and make
Egypt an adjunct of his own imperial greatness.
If Napoleon had read and believed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
twenty-ninth chapter of Ezekiel, he could
have spared himself this useless and expensive
campaign. We all recall that when victory
seemed to be in sight, Napoleon&rsquo;s power
and greatness shattered itself upon an immovable
rock. This was composed of the
small remnant of indomitable British who
refused to recognize the fact of their defeat
when it stared them in the face. And that
courageous and noble refusal to give up, when
they were quite evidently hopelessly overthrown,
was again vindicated in the final
result. The army of Napoleon was broken,
discomfited, decimated, and defeated. Finally,
it was deserted by its discouraged leader,
who probably never knew why he had
failed. He was not fighting against the allies
only, nor was he defeated entirely by British
valour. Napoleon was fighting against the
Word of God and the will of Him whose hand
is able to raise to power and to cast down
again. From that hour to this, and even in
our present moment of historic time, Egypt
remains the basest of the kingdoms of the
earth.</p>
<p>To come back to the miserable Hophra, his
final end came when he was assassinated by
his own general, whose name is given by the
Greeks as Amasis and who appears on the
monuments under the name of Iahmose.
Amasis occupied the throne until the final
conquest by Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>We note again the coincidence of ancient
records with the accounts that portray these
events in the books of II Chronicles, Jeremiah,
and Ezekiel. Voluminous sections of
the Word of God are extended a strong and
friendly hand of historical authentication by
the secular records which have survived
from that time.</p>
<p>In the British Museum will be found tablets,
stelae, portraits, and sculptured remnants
from Egypt which have been derived
from those unsettled times. In the Egyptian
collection of the British Museum, the exhibit
numbered 1358 contains a portrait of Hophra.
There are also a number of scarabs in Table
Case &ldquo;B&rdquo; in the Fourth Egyptian Room, and
a fragmentary sistrum in the Fifth Egyptian
Room, all of which bear the name of Hophra
and authenticate his record.</p>
<p>Thus we have seen in a brief but accurate
recapitulation of generations and centuries
of history that dead men do tell tales! We
have Hophra&rsquo;s record together with the annalistic
tablet of Amasis to aid us in our
understanding of these stirring days. Added
to that, the record of Nebuchadnezzar brings
additional confirmation of the thesis that is
maintained in this brief work.</p>
<p><i>The evidence of archeology as it bears upon
the text of God&rsquo;s Word is final and complete
wherever men have delved into the records of
those days.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>It may not be exactly what was in the mind
of the Lord Jesus Christ when He uttered
the words, but we can certainly apply to the
generation in which we live, His striking
statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If men should hold their tongues, the very
stones would cry out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if <i>living</i> men will not speak the truth
concerning the finality of the Bible&mdash;<i>dead
men must!</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">317</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />Vindication of Daniel</h2>
<p>Nowhere in all this long and profitable
study has archeology more perfectly and
thoroughly vindicated the accuracy of the
Scripture than in those portions of the disputed
record that are found in the Book of
Daniel.</p>
<p>A great deal remains to be discovered at
Nineveh and Babylon, and it is highly probable
that the excavations to the present hour
have but scraped the surface of the marvelous
treasure that remains to be uncovered.
It is a happy circumstance, however, that in
our present incomplete but numerous sources,
a great deal of information has been brought
to light in vindication of the prophet Daniel.</p>
<p>In the heyday of its brief popularity, the
school of higher criticism pounced with great
glee on the alleged inaccuracies and historical
errors in the Book of Daniel. The general
argument against the integrity of this writing
may be summed up in a simple resum&eacute;.
In the Book of Daniel, there are supposed to
be a number of outstanding philological anachronisms.
The school of higher criticism,
in its weird procedure, made great capital of
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
the presumed cultural development of the
people with whom the record dealt.</p>
<p>Daniel is pictured in the Bible as having
lived and written in the last days of the
Babylonian dynasties. He was carried away
from his native land as a lad when the wrath
of Nebuchadnezzar was poured out on Jerusalem
in the days of Zedekiah. He lived
throughout the reign of each of the last
Babylonian kings, and was alive when Cyrus
signed the decree that enabled the remnant
to return to Jerusalem. No leader of Hebrew
life and thought lived in a more stirring span
of history than did Daniel.</p>
<p>The bright minds of the higher critics,
which were never limited in their flights of
fancy by historical fact, concluded that the
Greek language could not have reached the
courts of Babylon until after the conquest of
Alexander. In examining the Hebrew text
of this book, the self-styled scholars claimed
to have found eleven Greek words in Daniel&rsquo;s
manuscript. The occurrence of these words
was sufficient evidence that the Book of
Daniel was not written in the days of the
Babylonian dynasty, but must have originated
after the exile and in the days of Alexander.
This was the first great argument
directed against the credibility and authenticity
of this prophecy.</p>
<p>The second alleged fallacy in the Book of
Daniel is to be found in the predication of
<span class="pb" id="Page_319">319</span>
the entire book. The sweep and movement
of Daniel&rsquo;s account begins with the adventure
of certain young lads of the royal seed
who were carried away as hostages to Babylon.
Daniel&rsquo;s own records state that by
orders of Nebuchadnezzar these young Hebrew
boys were put in the schools of learning
where they might be instructed in the wisdom
of Babylon, and taught patriotism, and affection
for the conquering power of Chaldea.
To this basis of the entire narrative criticism
objected vociferously and strenuously. The
argument advanced by this now discredited
school was that the brutal conquerors of that
day did not treat their hostages with such
kindness and courtesy, and so the entire
record was declared to be incompatible with
the known facts of history.</p>
<p>The third and more serious objection of
the critics was directed against the appearance
in Daniel&rsquo;s manuscript of certain stories
which were alleged to consist of pure myths.
Among these is the story of the three Hebrew
children in the fiery furnace. The demands
of intelligence were supposed to find this utterly
unreasonable and the doubters declared
that such a miracle could not have occurred.</p>
<p>Another weakness in the structure of the
narrative was presumed to be found in the
preservation of Daniel in the den of lions.
In fact, this whole record was relegated to
the realm of improbability, as this method
<span class="pb" id="Page_320">320</span>
of execution was never practiced by the
Babylonians. These objections constituted
the case in the dogmatic assertions of the
advocates of higher criticism.</p>
<p>The strange experience of Nebuchadnezzar
for the year of his madness, when he supposed
himself a beast of the field and lived
without the benefits of his civilization, added
strength to this objection against the historicity
of a book that incorporates in its structure
such palpable fables.</p>
<p>The final and most crushing argument,
however, was the discovery of certain alleged
historical inaccuracies that permeate the text
of Daniel.</p>
<p>When Nebuchadnezzar died, the kingdom
seems to have fallen into a condition that
was little short of anarchy. Nebuchadnezzar
the Second reigned from 604 B. C. to 561 B. C.
Upon his death, he was succeeded by Evil-merodach
who reigned for two years. This
unhappy monarch passed off the scene by
violence, and his murderer, Neriglissar, succeeded
him to the throne.</p>
<p>After a short reign he, in turn, was removed
by Labshi-marduk who reigned but
the portion of a year. He also met a sudden
and unfortunate end and the succession was
in a condition of anarchy.</p>
<p>Being backed by the army, Nabonidus, who
according to most accounts was the son-in-law
of Nebuchadnezzar, saved the throne and
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
established himself in power. Having the
complete confidence and trust of the military,
he established his dominion and reigned from
555 B. C. to 538.</p>
<p>But in the year 538, Cyrus the Great captured
Babylon and overran the entire kingdom.
Cyrus reigned until 529 and was followed
by Cambyses. In 521, Cambyses was
succeeded by Darius who, in turn, gave place
to Xerxes.</p>
<p>Thus we have a complete and fairly accurate
record of those stirring days that followed
Nebuchadnezzar. But in all profane
history there was no record of a king by the
name of Belshazzar. Yet a surprising portion
of the Book of Daniel is given over to
the events and incidents in the life and reign
of this &ldquo;mythical&rdquo; king. According to the
critics, such historical inaccuracy was sufficient
to condemn the manuscript. Upon
these and lesser grounds, therefore, criticism
tore Daniel out of the Old Testament and
denied him any place in the records of
credible historians.</p>
<p>Had the hopeful enemies of faith waited
but a few short years, they might have saved
themselves all this work and trouble. So
thoroughly has the voice of archeology accredited
the accuracy of Daniel&rsquo;s writings,
that those who foolishly surrendered their
faith in the historicity of this Book, have
been forced to replace the disputed record,
<span class="pb" id="Page_322">322</span>
and Daniel has been vindicated as has no
other questioned writer of antiquity.</p>
<p>To bring a brief and simple refutation of
this critical argument concerning alleged
discrepancies, we shall go back to the primary
argument.</p>
<p>The reign of Nebuchadnezzar was characterized
by a recrudescence of architecture
and busy years of building. The great king
spent his enormous revenues in the construction
of public buildings, and the land blossomed
under his influence and sway. It was
inevitable that the delvings at the site of
Babylon should have brought to light some
of the palaces and works of this great kingdom.
It was the custom among the Babylonian
builders to mark their public buildings,
even as we do in our present culture.
Upon the cornerstone of our city hall or court
house, we engrave the name and purpose of
the building, with the date of its erection.
Over the doorways of our libraries and public
buildings we chisel deeply into the building
stones the name of the building and a
brief dedication. It seemed to be almost
providential that one of the first great marble
palaces discovered in the ruins of Babylon
was designated by the builders themselves
as &ldquo;The Place of Learning.&rdquo; There captive
princes were taught the learning of Chaldea.</p>
<p>This one discovery reopened the whole
case of the credibility of Daniel. His historicity
<span class="pb" id="Page_323">323</span>
was questioned primarily upon the
grounds that <i>such schools did not exist</i>, and
captives were not so treated. The foundational
vindication of Daniel that emerged
from the dust of countless centuries, caused
a re-examination of the entire structure that
criticism had reared against his integrity.
The result was a complete vindication of
Daniel and his record.</p>
<p>The argument of philology also turned
against its producers and showed that their
case against Daniel was baseless. It has
been shown that eight of the eleven alleged
Greek words in Daniel&rsquo;s manuscript are
Sumerian and not Hellenistic. At one time
the Sumerian language was the universal
language of ancient diplomacy. As French
was the language of international correspondence
until recent times, when it has been
largely displaced by English, so most of the
courts of antiquity conducted much of their
business in the Sumerian tongue. This custom,
however, was discontinued by the time
of the Persian conquest. If there is any
value in the argument of philology for the
dating of a manuscript, the evidence is conclusive
that Daniel could not have written
after the time of Nebuchadnezzar, for the
Sumerian language was no longer in use
from that time on.</p>
<p>The three bona fide Greek words that do
occur in Daniel&rsquo;s writings are an evidence
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
for his accuracy and historical fidelity, rather
than a source of criticism, as has been implied.
These three words are the names of
musical instruments that were Greek in
origin. The language of music was and is
universal and it did not take generations
for such words to penetrate to the courts of
other nations. As an instance, the reader
may remember that the seven-stringed harp
was invented by the Greek poet Terpander.
Assur-bani-pal died twenty-five years after
the invention of this harp. He shows it,
however, upon his monuments, and the statement
is made that one was buried with the
king. The Babylonian records depict this
harp under its Greek name. Thus we see
that instead of taking centuries for a Greek
word to reach Babylon, this word had become
a household word in a few short years.
So the argument of philology turns out to be
a boomerang which returns to smite the critic
who hurled it.</p>
<p>The tales that are told by dead men who
have no purpose in deceiving the living, not
only enhance our understanding of this disputed
text, but bring to us irrefutable evidence
of its scrupulous accuracy. The case
for Daniel&rsquo;s vindication is even more graphically
presented when we come to the realm
of these sections of alleged folklore and fable.</p>
<p>It is of course necessary that the careful
scholar walk warily so as not to over-emphasize
<span class="pb" id="Page_325">325</span>
the facts at his disposal. There is a
tendency among those who have a justified
confidence in the Book of God to allow their
natural elation over the illuminating vindication
wrought for the Scripture by archeology
to result in an unfortunate over-emphasis.
Here is where we face an illustration
of such a tendency.</p>
<p>In one of the earlier excavations at Babylon
a peculiar building was uncovered which
at first sight appeared to be a firing kiln in
which bricks or pottery might be baked. It
was rounded in the typical shape common to
the ancient beehive, which is preserved even
among some of our kilns of the present generation.
When the inscription was deciphered
that designated the purpose of the building,
however, it was startling to read, &ldquo;This
is the place of burning where men who blasphemed
the gods of Chaldea died by fire.&rdquo;
The tremendous significance of this discovery
becomes at once apparent. The tendency
would be to explain with delight, &ldquo;We have
discovered the fiery furnace where Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego walked with the
Son of God.&rdquo; Such an application of this
fact, however, would not quite be warranted.
This may or may not have been the Scriptural
site of that great miracle. We can say,
however, that the three Hebrew children in
the fiery furnace can no longer be consigned
to the columns of mythology and dismissed
<span class="pb" id="Page_326">326</span>
as simple folklore. This discovery has showed
us without doubt that there <i>was</i> such a
furnace as Daniel depicts. It was customary
to punish blasphemy in this fashion, and the
Chaldean monuments and annals are replete
with instances of men being burned alive,
who had angered the king or rebelled against
his sovereignty.</p>
<p>So, then, the implacable, unrelenting voice
of archeology penetrates the innermost retreats
of higher criticism to destroy, in this
instance, their familiar and favorite argument
of folklore and mythology.</p>
<p>No less dramatic and interesting was the
accidental experience of the famed excavator
Dieulafoy, who fell into what at first
sight would have been called an ancient well.
Being rescued by his companions from his
uncomfortable, but in nowise dangerous, situation,
they proceeded with their work to
the point of identification. The well turned
out to be a pit which was used as an open
cage for wild animals, and upon the curb
was found the inscription, &ldquo;The place of execution
where men who angered the king died
torn by wild animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again we must tread cautiously, for
we cannot say with dogmatic finality, &ldquo;This
is the place of Daniel&rsquo;s experience.&rdquo; We
<i>can</i> say, however, with positive assurance
that <i>there was such a pit of execution</i>, and the
only unusual feature in Daniel&rsquo;s experience
<span class="pb" id="Page_327">327</span>
was that he came out alive under the defense
and protection of the God whom he served.</p>
<p>In the excavation of the palace at Shushan,
an ancient record was uncovered giving a
list of four hundred eighty-four men of high
degree who thus died in a den of lions. The
name of Daniel was not found among them.
This might be accepted as collateral evidence
that Daniel escaped alive from that place of
execution.</p>
<p>Even the strange experience of Nebuchadnezzar,
who dreamed that he would be turned
into a wild beast and roam the fields like an
ox, has also been accredited. It will be remembered
that the mighty monarch dreamed
of a tree that stood in the center of the earth
and grew to an unprecedented height. Its
towering branches swept the heavens and
from all the ends of the earth its foliage was
visible. Fruit hung upon this tree that satisfied
the needs of men, and the very beasts
of the field shadowed themselves under its
spreading branches. Even the fowls of the
air dwelt safely therein, and all living things
drew strength and protection from this
mighty growth.</p>
<p>The dream continued to the point where
a Holy One came down from heaven and
ordered the destruction of the tree. The
trunk, the branches, the leaves, and the fruit
were all to be swept away, but the stump
and roots were to be undisturbed. The heart
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
was to be changed from a man&rsquo;s heart, and
the heart of an animal was to be given it
until seven times should pass over that stump.
This drastic action was explained by the
Holy One as being intended to teach the high
and lordly king that only the Most High rules
in the kingdom of man, and that He gives
dominion to whomsoever He will. He has
the right and authority to make the basest
of men to sit in the places of highest power
and to humble the most lordly.</p>
<p>Upon coming to Daniel with his troubled
spirit, the king sought an interpretation of
the dream. Daniel recounts that for the
passing of an hour he was so astonished and
troubled in heart he could not find the
strength to speak. The king, whose kindly
affection for Daniel is one of the wonders
of that day, besought him to speak frankly
and not to allow his affection and regard for
Nebuchadnezzar to hinder him from telling
the complete truth to the troubled king.
Daniel&rsquo;s interpretation was given in simple
but graphic words: The tree which grew and
reached the heavens, whose leaves, branches,
and fruits sheltered and nurtured all flesh,
was a symbol of the mighty Nebuchadnezzar.
(It is true that in the day of Nebuchadnezzar
he builded a world empire, as far as the cultured
races of mankind extended.) But because
of the high pride which was natural
to the human heart over such great accomplishments,
<span class="pb" id="Page_329">329</span>
the Most High God had decreed
that the king should be humbled. He should
forsake the councils and fellowship of men
and sleep in the open fields, wet with the
dew of heaven; imagining himself to be one
with the beasts of the earth, Nebuchadnezzar
was to learn humility.</p>
<p>Daniel then pleaded with the king that by
repentance and restitution he should forsake
his sins and dedicate himself to the pursuit
of righteousness. Thus by showing mercy,
he might receive grace and his iniquities be
blotted out.</p>
<p>Twelve months later the prophetic dream
was fulfilled. As the king strolled on the
roof of his great palace, he surveyed the
might of Babylon and boasted in his heart
saying, &ldquo;This great Babylon have I not myself
built it; have I not erected this kingdom
and this house by the might of my own power
and for the honour of my majesty.&rdquo; While
this exalted boast was still echoing upon the
king&rsquo;s lips, there fell a voice from heaven
which said that the hour of the fulfillment
of the prophecy had come.</p>
<p>Madness fell upon Nebuchadnezzar, and
he fled from the presence of men. Sleeping
in the open fields and dwelling with the
beasts of the earth, his hair grew as long as
an eagle&rsquo;s feathers and his nails became like
the claws of a bird. During those seven years
of the madness of Nebuchadnezzar, his faithful
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">330</span>
counselors administered his kingdom, apparently
in the earnest hope that the reason
of the king would be restored. Their confidence
was justified, for at the end of seven
years the king recounts that he lifted up his
eyes to heaven and understanding returned
to him. Thereupon he blessed the Most High
God and swore that he would bless and
honour Him that liveth forever. He confessed
that the dominion of God is an everlasting
dominion and His kingdom is eternal.
His psalm of praise exalted Almighty God
above the reach of men.</p>
<p>When his reason had thus been restored,
the king again occupied the throne of
Babylon and profited by this experience.
The glory and honour of his kingdom he
henceforth attributed unto the majesty and
kindness of God. The king testified personally
that the words of God are true and His
judgments righteous. He turned to monotheism,
and became the greatest convert, perhaps,
that Daniel had made in all of his ministry.</p>
<p>This brief account of those amazing seven
years is given by Daniel in the fourth chapter
of his great prophecy. The literal words of
the king are preserved for us in that historical
record. This is perhaps the most outstanding
instance of critical repudiation of the
text that we have in the Old Testament. The
whole record was uncompromisingly declared
<span class="pb" id="Page_331">331</span>
to be a fabrication of a vivid imagination.</p>
<p><i>It fell to the lot of the great Sir Henry Rawlinson
to find the original document wherein
Nebuchadnezzar tells this episode exactly as
Daniel had given it.</i></p>
<p>The most dramatic and astonishing vindication
of the integrity of the text that the
Book of Daniel has sustained, providentially
occurred in that field of criticism which
was supposed to be the strongest evidence
that criticism possessed. This was in the
realm of the historical accuracy of the Book
of Daniel. The basis of the critical contention
was right to a certain extent. Profane
history possessed no record of a king in Babylon
by the name of Belshazzar. When the
period of anarchy in Babylon ended by
means of the military coup that placed Nabonidus
upon the throne, it took a short
while to quiet the realm and re&euml;stablish the
authority of the crown. Nabonidus then gave
himself to a period of construction and rehabilitation.
In the course of his work on
the fortifications of his capital city, Nabonidus
was strengthening the walls at certain
neglected points. Delving deeply, to buttress
the foundations, he came upon the ruins of
an ancient palace which had been built centuries
before by Narum-sin.</p>
<p>The discovery so delighted king Nabonidus
that he became a confirmed archeologist. He
reconstructed this palace of Narum-sin and
<span class="pb" id="Page_332">332</span>
turned it into a museum of antiquity. The
delight of discovery drove the energetic
Nabonidus into expeditions far and wide.
The administration of the kingdom became
of secondary importance to him. He had a
son whose name appears in the ancient records
as &ldquo;Belt-sar-utzar,&rdquo; which is given in
the record of Daniel as Bel-shazzar. Upon
the thirtieth birthday of his son, Nabonidus
made him regent, and the throne of Babylon
was thenceforth occupied jointly by Nabonidus
and Bel-shazzar. Because the more common
form is familiar to our readers, we
will from this point on designate him by
the Biblical name of Belshazzar.</p>
<p>The decrees and laws were signed, of
course, by the seal of Nabonidus, the senior
monarch, but the practical administration
was left in the hands of the regent. This will
explain why Belshazzar, wishing to honour
Daniel for the interpretation of the writing
upon the wall, with which we shall deal later,
offered to make him the <i>third</i> ruler of the
kingdom. This, of course, is eminently unorthodox!
It was always the custom in antiquity,
if records can be trusted, to honour
a man by giving him the hand of the king&rsquo;s
daughter in marriage and making him ruler
over <i>half</i> the kingdom. Belshazzar could not
go so far as this. Nabonidus, his father, was
the number one ruler as long as he lived.
Belshazzar, the regent, was the second ruler
<span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
of the realm. Therefore, if Daniel became
prime minister and had an office second in
authority to Belshazzar, <i>he would be the third
ruler in the kingdom</i>.</p>
<p>How amazing indeed is the historical accuracy
of this ancient Book! These writers
were faultless in their efforts to keep the
Scripture in line with the historical facts.
In this case they have been inspired even in
their choice of numerical descriptions in the
honours conferred upon their heroic characters.</p>
<p>So now we peer into ancient Babylon
through the telescope of archeology and we
see a quaint situation. Nabonidus, the kind
and able monarch, fascinated with the study
of antiquities, has left the active control of
the kingdom to his son and heir, Belshazzar.
The prince regent, however, was not able
to stand prosperity. He seems to have degenerated
into a drunken profligate who
spent all of his time in the dubious pleasures
of sin. The administration of the kingdom
fell on evil days during the brief span of time
that Belshazzar was in authority. As nearly
as we can build an accurate and credible
chronology from the now available records
of Babylon, Belshazzar became regent in 541
B. C., and in the year 538 B. C. the Babylonian
dynasty disappeared.</p>
<p>In those three years great and marvelous
events were being shaped in the womb of
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">334</span>
time. Cyrus, thereafter called the Great, had
previously begun his phenomenal rise to
power. Apparently he had been born a minor
prince in an obscure tribe of the Medes, but
was endowed with genius and brilliancy from
his early youth. The picture that is now
painted of Cyrus, as we see him in the treasured
records, depicts this fascinating personality
engaged first of all in welding the
scattered families of the Medes into a close,
binding organization that made them a power.
So rapid was his climb to dominion, there
is no other explanation to account for the
phenomenon than that of Isaiah, who in his
forty-fifth chapter, states that the Lord God
Almighty Himself had raised Cyrus to the
position of world dominion. This prophecy
we shall refer to later; but our present purpose
is to show the conjunction of Cyrus
with Belshazzar.</p>
<p>We come to a period of time when the
records are fragmentary, but it is evident
now that Cyrus the Mede became naturalized
as a Persian that he might occupy that throne
and combine it with his own kingdom. When
the youthful Cyrus had combined Media and
Persia into one great dominion, a new world
empire was born, although it was not immediately
apparent. After a number of successful
forays and campaigns that enlarged
his possessions and strengthened his position
until he felt himself to be well nigh invincible,
<span class="pb" id="Page_335">335</span>
the ambitious Cyrus turned his eyes
toward Babylon. He realized that if he possessed
Babylon, he would indeed be the master
of the earth.</p>
<p>Cyrus is reported to have sent an ambassador
to Nabonidus saying, &ldquo;Come thou under
my yoke and I will be thy protection and
defense.&rdquo; The modern system of &lsquo;muscling
in&rsquo; is supposed to be a development of the
racketeers of our generation. These modern
pragmatists, however, are merely amateur
performers at an old game, at which the
ancients were masters. This invitation of
Cyrus, of course, could be interpreted only
one way. In the vernacular of the modern
day, it was a case of surrender, &ldquo;or else.&rdquo;
When the Persian ambassador arrived at the
court of Babylon, Nabonidus was absent on
one of his many expeditions. Belshazzar, as
usual, was in the midst of a drunken orgy and
was more concerned with the hilarity of the
hour than with the future safety of the kingdom.
With that ill-guided and perverse humour
which is characteristic of the insanity
of drunkenness, the Regent conceived a brilliant
jest. He caused the ambassador to be
hewed into pieces and packed into a basket
which was returned to Cyrus with a note saying,
&ldquo;This we will do to you and your army
if you invade our empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this insult was delivered to Cyrus,
the outraged king was so wild with indignation
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">336</span>
that he could not contain himself long
enough to assemble his army. He ordered
Darius the chief of his bodyguard, who was
one of his Median counselors and companions,
to assemble an advance force and lay siege
to the city. While Darius invested the city,
Cyrus was to follow with the balance of his
cohort. Thus the scene was set for the most
singular episode of those stirring days.</p>
<p>It occurred on the birthday of Belshazzar,
which marked the beginning of the third year
of his regency. The ignoble king had gathered
to himself all the lords and ladies of his
court, the thousand dissolute companions who
were the fellows-in-drunkenness of this king.
Belshazzar again conceived a drunken jest,
which struck him as highly humourous. In
the midst of their debauch, he ordered that
the sacred vessels, which his grandfather,
Nebuchadnezzar, had taken from the temple
of God in Jerusalem, should be brought to
the table to be used as flagons for their drinking
bout. This was done, and as this godless
and idolatrous crew drank from the holy
implements dedicated to the God of Israel,
they toasted the idols of Babylon and sang
their praise.</p>
<p>Even while they were thus engaged, according
to the fifth chapter of Daniel, a hand
appeared which wrote on the wall and pronounced
the doom of the kingdom. Almost
at this exact hour, Darius, the counselor,
<span class="pb" id="Page_337">337</span>
friend and commander of the vanguard of
Cyrus&rsquo; army, appeared before the walls of
Babylon!</p>
<p>To the surprise of the great Median general,
the gates of the city were open. This
is according to his own record. It being the
birthday of Belshazzar, the entire city was
celebrating in a fashion made popular and
characteristic by the debauched ruler. Wine
had been provided for the guards that they
also might share in the happy celebration
of the king&rsquo;s natal day. The drunken soldiers
had failed to close the city gates with the
coming of nightfall, and by the time Darius
appeared before the city, they were in a
stupor of drunkenness. The able Mede,
skilled in all the arts of ancient warfare,
moved swiftly, well knowing the value of a
surprise attack. His company, although few
in number when compared to the complete
might of the armed forces of Cyrus, was sufficient
to hold the city, if it could be gained.</p>
<p>Daring men fell upon the drunken guards
and slew them. Leaving a small company
to guard the gate and keep it open, Darius&rsquo;
troops swept through the city to the very
palace of Belshazzar. Slaying all whom they
met upon the way, they fell upon the royal
company with a shock of complete surprise.
Scarcely had the voice of Daniel finished
interpreting the words that the hand of God
had written upon the wall, when the sword
<span class="pb" id="Page_338">338</span>
of Darius fulfilled the prophecy by slaying
Belshazzar. Darius caused the head of Belshazzar
to be sent to Cyrus with a grim and
brief note, saying &ldquo;The kingdom is thine.
Do thou enter.&rdquo; When Cyrus, therefore,
came with his mighty company, the city
already had been captured by Darius and
Cyrus had only to make a triumphal entry.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Nabonidus heard that his
kingdom was invaded, so he gathered a force
and marched to the relief of Babylon. When
he arrived, however, he found that the city
was already in the possession of Cyrus. Acting
with characteristic wisdom, he laid down
his arms, surrendered to Cyrus and cast himself
upon the mercy of the great king. He
was well received, and lived as an honoured
guest in the court of Cyrus until he died a
natural death several years later.</p>
<p>Cyrus ruled Babylon through Darius, his
counselor and friend, whose courage and
strategy were rewarded when the king made
him satrap of Babylon. Herein is found a
reconciliation of the apparent contradiction
between the two statements made by Darius
and Cyrus concerning the fate of the king of
Babylon. Although the critics never bothered
to notice such, archeology has its difficulties
as well as has Scripture.</p>
<p>Darius tersely recounts, &ldquo;In the night that
I captured Babylon, I slew the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The annalistic tablet of Cyrus, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_339">339</span>
contains this note, &ldquo;In the day that I entered
Babylon, I made the king my captive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contradiction is more fancied than
real. The two generals are speaking about
two different kings! Darius killed King
Belshazzar; Cyrus made King Nabonidus his
captive and friend.</p>
<p>Because of the insult that Belshazzar had
offered to his majesty, Cyrus caused the Regent&rsquo;s
name to be stricken from all the available
records and thus Belshazzar&rsquo;s name
passed out of history and faded from the
memory of men. <i>For twenty-five hundred years
the only record of the name of Belshazzar that
was preserved for posterity was found in the
writings of Daniel. This very historic accuracy
of Daniel was the source of a great deal of the
critical rejection of his notable writing!</i></p>
<p>The first discovery in archeology that shed
light upon these events was the prayer cylinder
of Nabonidus. Upon the ascension of
Belshazzar to the regency of the kingdom,
Nabonidus caused to be engraved in all the
temples of Bel a prayer for the protection,
praise, and prosperity of his son, Belt-sar-utsar.
In the excavations at Mukkayyar, one
of the great buildings uncovered was the
temple of the moon god. In each of the four
corners of the building, Nabonidus, who had
rebuilt the temple, had caused a clay cylinder
to be buried containing the record of the
work. On this cylinder, which dedicated the
<span class="pb" id="Page_340">340</span>
rebuilding of an ancient temple which was
originally constructed about seventeen centuries
before the day of Nabonidus, the
kindly king engraved the prayer for his son
and heir, to which we have previously referred.</p>
<p>The name of the moon god was Sin, and
he was one of the chief deities of the land of
Babylon. The wording on the cylinder that
particularly interests the student of historical
accuracy is found in these words: &ldquo;Oh,
Sin, thou lord of the gods, thou king of the
gods of heaven and of earth, and of the gods
of the gods, who dwellest in heaven, when
thou enterest with joy into this temple, may
the good fortune of the temples E-sagil, E-zida
and E-gish-shirgal, the temples of thine exalted
godhead be established at thy word.
And set thou the fear of thine exalted godhead
in the hearts of my people, that they
sin not against thine exalted godhead, and
let them stand fast like the heavens. <i>And
as for me, Nabonidus, the king of Babylon,
protect thou me from sinning against thine
exalted godhead and grant thou me graciously
a long life and in the heart of Belshazzar, my
first born son, the offspring of my loins, set the
fear of thine exalted godhead so he may commit
no sin and that he may be satisfied with the fullness
of life.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the British Museum, Table Case &ldquo;G&rdquo;
in the magnificent Babylonian Room contains
<span class="pb" id="Page_341">341</span>
these cylinders, which are numbered 91,125
to 91,128; the cylinders of Nabonidus are
many. Some of them recount his building
operations, while others give the record of
his discoveries of some of the great monuments
of antiquity in the search for which
he spent so much of his time and treasure.
Perhaps no single event in the long records
of archeology so startled and delighted the
careful students whose interest was in the
authority of the Word of God, as did this
discovery of the name of Belshazzar. In one
magnificent demonstration archeology thus
accredited the <i>history</i> included in the prophecies
of Daniel, and shattered the conclusions
of criticism beyond the possibility of recovery.</p>
<p>Also in this same section and case of the
British Museum, there is a portion of a baked
clay cylinder inscribed by Cyrus. This bears
the Museum number of 90,920 and is a priceless
record. We are tempted to believe in
the providential preservation of this fragment,
since the balance of the tablet has
been destroyed and is missing. In this particular
record, Cyrus describes his conquest
of Babylon, following a recital of some of
the chief preliminary events in the early
part of his reign. He ascribes his good success
to the god Marduk. He tells how he
had forced all nations to accept his standard
until finally, under divine command, Marduk
<span class="pb" id="Page_342">342</span>
caused him to go to Babylon. Because
of the significance of this statement and its
bearing upon our foregoing paragraphs, we
reproduce this much of the words of Cyrus,
&ldquo;Marduk the great lord, the protector of his
people beheld his good deeds and his righteous
heart with joy. He commanded him to
go to Babylon and he caused him to set out
on the road to the city and like a friend and
ally, he marched by his side; and his troops
with our weapons girt about them, marched
with him in countless numbers like the waters
of a flood. Without battle and without
fighting, Marduk made him enter into his
city of Babylon; he spared Babylon tribulation
and Nabonidus the king who feared him
not, he delivered into his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Babylonian sources of the British Museum
also contain an amazing number of highly
important documents which cover every
year of the reign of Cyrus in Babylon, namely,
B. C. 538 to 529. These records are concerned
with commercial transactions, legal business
and documents that deal with the personal
and public life of the people. Such homely
affairs as a deed recording a loan of three
thousand bundles of onions from one man to
another is legally dated by the year of the
ascendency of Cyrus. The apprenticeship
of slaves to various masters in the arts and
sciences, the worship of the people, the blossoming
of prosperity under the firm but
<span class="pb" id="Page_343">343</span>
kind rule of Cyrus, all make up a wonderful
picture of those days and times. Therein
are included apparently unconscious references
to the historic events that are of such
tremendous interest to those who today read
the Word of God in the light of this historical
illumination.</p>
<p>There are, of course, also many private
and public letters preserved from this period
which are found in Table Case &ldquo;H&rdquo; of the
Babylonian Room, where they are available
to the student who cares to delve into the
minute evidences of those days and times.</p>
<p>We shall have to condense a great deal of
this material, however, into the one simple
statement that <i>the Book of Daniel is historically
accredited by these voluminous records</i>!
Thus there is only one possible basis whereupon
criticism of Daniel may be continued
today. In all kindness, but in absolute assurance,
we must say that the rejection of
the historicity of Daniel by our generation
can be predicated only upon complete ignorance
of an amazing body of historical
knowledge that is available to the student.
Either that, or there is a sad desire in the
heart of the critic to frustrate the purpose
of the Word of God even at the expense of
the surrender of personal integrity. The
original construction of the case against
Daniel did appear formidable at first. It
has turned out, however, to be a tissue of
<span class="pb" id="Page_344">344</span>
falsehood, and Daniel has emerged from
the den of liars unharmed and under the
continuing protection of God, even as he came
forth in safety from the den of lions.</p>
<p>With the coming of Cyrus, the Assyrian
and Babylonian dynasties ended and Persian
history began. Much of this period of the
Persian sway was contemporaneous with the
times of the Maccabees, and is of tremendous
importance and interest to the student of the
history of Israel. But since that same period
parallels the four hundred silent years, during
which the voice of God was not heard
through the prophets, and sacred revelation
is awaiting the appearance of Jesus Christ,
there is very little of archeological value
from those years that can be useful to the
establishment of our present thesis.</p>
<p>The exception to this would be seen in the
case of the return of the people to rebuild
Jerusalem, and to establish a Jewish culture,
so that Jesus could be born in the land of
Israel, and minister to the people of Israel,
as the prophecies had foretold. The events
of this return are told in the prophecies of
Ezra and Nehemiah, which are abundantly
substantiated by secular evidence, and have
thus not been questioned or disputed by
criticism to any major extent. Cyrus has left
an account of this return, and the great king
seemed to be vastly elated over the opportunity
<span class="pb" id="Page_345">345</span>
thus to show kindness to the people of
Israel.</p>
<p>According to the record that is generally
received, Cyrus the Great signed the decree
authorizing the return of the children of
Israel to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and
the temple of God, primarily because of one
of those fascinating anticipations of coming
events which is the peculiar field of prophecy.</p>
<p>It is recorded that the scribe Zerubbabel
entered the presence of Cyrus and with the
grandiloquent salutation of that day bowed
himself and said, &ldquo;Oh king live forever! Be
it known unto my lord the king that our God
hath named him by name in the prophecy of
His sacred writings generations before the
king was born.&rdquo; When Cyrus expressed a
desire to inquire into this wonder, there was
brought into his presence the scroll of the
prophet Isaiah and to him was read the forty-fifth
chapter. The opening verses of this
chapter contained this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus,
whose right hand I have holden, to subdue
nations before him; and I will loose the loins
of kings, to open before him the two leaved
gates; and the gates shall not be shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go before thee, and make the crooked
places straight: I will break in pieces the gates
of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will give thee the treasures of darkness,
and hidden riches of secret places, that
thou mayest know that I, the Lord, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_346">346</span>
call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.
For Jacob my servant&rsquo;s sake, and Israel mine
elect, I have even called thee by thy name:
I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not
known me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a significant prophecy indeed!
Isaiah wrote these words about the year 712
B. C. Cyrus took over the dominion of Babylon
538 B. C. So in this ancient prophecy the
conqueror is named by name some century
and a half before he was born. His conquest
of all nations was clearly delineated and the
explanation was given that God had pre-named
him for the sake of the thing that he
should later do for Israel. Astounded and
deeply moved by this evidence of divine
favour, Cyrus wrote a notable decree which
is preserved for us in these exact words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, the Lord
God of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms
of the earth; and he hath charged me
to build him an house at Jerusalem which
is in Judah. Who is there among you of all
His people? his God be with him and let him
go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and
build the house of the Lord God of Israel,
(he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem, and
whosoever remaineth in any place where he
sojourneth, let the men of his place help him
with silver, and with gold, and with goods,
and with beasts, besides the free-will offering
for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this authority, the remnant returned
<span class="pb" id="Page_347">347</span>
to start that magnificent epic of the history
of Israel that climaxed with the coming of
the Redeemer of whom also Isaiah had written.</p>
<p>There is a sense of frustration that is inevitable
to any writer who attempts to cover
so vast a subject as this present work in the
limits of one small volume. The difficulty
has not been in finding evidence to support
the thesis that &ldquo;dead men tell tales&rdquo; which
vindicate the historical infallibility of the
Bible. We have been embarrassed by too
much evidence! So we have sought to present
only the most striking cases, such as
can be confirmed by any reader, without the
background of years of archeological education.
Unlimited tons of material have been
passed over with scarcely a mention, due to
the limitation of time and space.</p>
<p>The author has hoped to achieve one purpose
in this volume, namely, the arousing of
a definite interest in the average reader
which will cause that person to study the
sacred page with understanding and appreciation
of its force and authority. &ldquo;These
Scriptures,&rdquo; said the Apostle Paul, &ldquo;are able
to make thee wise unto salvation.&rdquo; It is imperative
in the light of this purpose, that they
be able to sustain their claim to divine origin
as well. With the prayer that God will bless
His Word to the salvation of the many in
these closing days, we have thus offered you
<span class="pb" id="Page_348">348</span>
the testimony of men long dead, whose words
nevertheless live on in the records of tablets
and tombs. And with those evidences, we
have also an increased assurance in the infallible
character of the Bible, and are historically
justified in receiving it &ldquo;as it is in
truth, the Word of God.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
